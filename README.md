# Automatic Detection for Binary Code Functionality

this project devoloped by: [Carol Hanna](https://github.com/carolhanna01) and [Abdallah Yassin](https://github.com/AbdallahYassin) during Project in Computer Security course - Technion. 

# Motivation and goals:
The main motivation for this project is to be a helpful tool for researchers of binary code. When analyzing a large binary, usually the researcher is only interested in short snippets that depict an interesting algorithm. The “gem” is often hidden in a very large puzzle. Having a tool that automatically identifies the functionality of different snippets, can ultimately be utilized by researchers as a tool to help them identify target snippets of code so that research resources can be directed to them efficiently.
