The Maverik examples are divided into 3 parts:

MPG - a set of worked examples which act as a tutorial to Maverik
and are documented in the MPG.

kernel - a number of (as yet) un-documented examples showing how to
use the Maverik kernel. By definition, these examples are at a very
low level and only advanced users would need to look at them.

misc - miscellaneous un-documented examples demonstrating various
features and techniques. The examples are briefly described in a
README the misc directory.

A number of applications built using Maverik can be found in the demos
directory.
