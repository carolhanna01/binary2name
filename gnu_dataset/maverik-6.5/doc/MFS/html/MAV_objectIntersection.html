<h2>Summary</h2>

Object/line intersection.
<p><hr>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
typedef struct {
  float pt1;
  float pt2;
  MAV_vector intpt;
  MAV_vector surnorm;
} MAV_objectIntersection;
</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>

The object intersection data structure, <tt>MAV_objectIntersection</tt>,
is used by intersection callback routines to report the details of
an object/line intersection test.<p>Currently, the only data held in this structure is <tt>pt1</tt> -- the distance
from the line's origin to the first intersection of the line with the
object. This value should be set to a negative number if the line does
not intersect the object (under these circumstances the intersection
callback routine should also return <tt>MAV_FALSE</tt>). If the line originates
inside the object, <tt>pt1</tt> is zero. <p>The <tt>MAV_objectIntersection</tt> for the object with the closest
intersection distance forms the <tt>objint</tt> field in event callback
data structures such as <tt>MAV_keyboardEvent</tt>.<p>(This data structure needs re-redesigning, and may well change in the
future.)
