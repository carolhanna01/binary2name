<h2>Summary</h2>

View parameters.
<p><hr>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
typedef struct {
  MAV_vector eye;
  MAV_vector view;
  MAV_vector up;
  MAV_vector fixed_up;
  MAV_viewModifierFn mod;
  MAV_vector right;
  MAV_vector trans_eye;
  MAV_vector trans_view;
  MAV_vector trans_up;
  MAV_vector trans_right;
  void *userdef;
} MAV_viewParams;
</pre>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The <tt>MAV_viewParams</tt> data structure defines the user's view, as follows:<p>
<ul><p><p><p><li> <tt>eye</tt>
position of the viewer's eye<p>
<p><li> <tt>view</tt>
normalized view direction vector, measured from the eye position<p>
<p><li> <tt>up</tt>
normalized view up vector<p>
<p><li> <tt>mod</tt>
at the start of each frame, the <tt>mod</tt> function is called. This arbitrarily
transforms the supplied viewing vectors to produce the viewing vectors
<tt>trans_eye</tt>, <tt>trans_view</tt>, <tt>trans_up</tt> and <tt>trans_right</tt>. It is these
transformed vectors that are actually used to define the view. Setting
this value to NULL, or using the <tt>MAV_viewModifierFn</tt> <b>mav_viewParamsFixed</b>, performs a null
transformation (that is, the transformed vectors are the same as the
supplied vectors). However, advanced users might wish to write their
own functions to implement, say, an over-the-shoulder view for an
avatar or a view whose orientation is matched to that of an HMD.<p>
<p><li> <tt>fixed_up</tt>
normalized world up vector, used by some navigation functions. This
field is optional but it is strongly recommended that it is defined.<p>
<p><li> <tt>right</tt>
not directly defined by the user but rather calculated at the start of
each frame by the kernel using the other viewing vectors. Since it is
used by many routines, it is stored in the data structure rather than
being calculated each time it is needed.<p>
<p><li> <tt>trans_view</tt>,  <tt>trans_up</tt>,  <tt>trans_right</tt>
see description of <tt>mod</tt>.<p>
<p><li> <tt>userdef</tt>
allows arbitrary application data to be added to this structure<p>
</ul><p>
The viewing frustum is only fully defined once the <tt>MAV_viewParams</tt> are
associated with a window, using the <b>mav_windowViewParamsSet</b> function, thus
defining the field of view, aspect ratio and near/far clip planes.
