<h2>Summary</h2>

Transparent object data.
<p><hr>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
typedef struct {
  MAV_window *win;
  MAV_object *obj;
  MAV_callbackDrawFn fn;
  MAV_drawInfo di;
  MAV_drawInfo *dip;
  MAV_matrix mat;
  MAV_BB bb;
  float dist2;
} MAV_transObjData;
</pre>
<p><hr>


<h2>Description</h2>

On executing the draw callback for a transparent object, the
<b>mav_transparentObjectsManage</b> function is called. This routine creates a
<tt>MAV_transObjData</tt> data structure for the object which contains all the
information necessary for it to be rendered at a later date: <tt>win</tt> is the window, <tt>obj</tt> is
the object, <tt>fn</tt> the draw callback function, <tt>di</tt> the drawing information to use, <tt>dip</tt> a pointer to <tt>di</tt> or NULL if <tt>di</tt> 
is not defined, <tt>mat</tt> the state of the graphics matrix and <tt>dist2</tt> and <tt>bb</tt> the
square of the distance from the object to the eye point and its bounding box (needed to
depth sort the objects).<p><b><a href=mav_transparentObjectsManage.html>mav_transparentObjectsManage</a></b> maintains a list of these data structures
(which is reset at the start of each frame). <b>mav_transparentObjectsRender</b> is
called at the end of the frame to traverse this list depth sorting the
objects and rendering them. This ensures that transparent objects are
dealt with correctly.<p>This use of this feature is controlled by the option variable
<tt>mav_opt_trans</tt> and is initially disabled. In order for object to take
advantage of this feature they must have callback function registered
to get their bounding box and surface parameters.
