<h2>Description</h2>

These function create and return an initialised SMS of the specified
type. <p>
<ul><p><p><p><li> <b><a href=mav_SMSObjListNew.html>mav_SMSObjListNew</a></b>
This function creates an "object list" type of SMS. This is the
simplest type of SMS and stores objects as a linked list in the order
in which they were inserted. View frustum culling is performed when
this SMS is displayed by calculating the axis aligned bounding box of
each object to determine if it is visible.<p>
<p><li> <b><a href=mav_SMSHBBNew.html>mav_SMSHBBNew</a></b>
This function create a "hierarchical bounding box" type of SMS. This
type of SMS is designed to store the static objects in the scene, i.e. those
who's size or position does not change. This restriction means that upon
insertion the object's axis aligned bounding box can be calculated and stored
for efficiency rather than being re-calculated each time it is
required which is the case for the "object list" SMS. Furthermore, as
objects are inserted a hierarchy of BB's is built up with the object's
BB at the leaf nodes. Testing a BB determines the action required for
all the objects beneath it in the hierarchy. View frustum culling is
performed when this SMS is displayed by testing the BB's
in the hierarchy which indicates either:<p>
<ul><p><p><p><li> that all objects beneath it can be removed from further consideration
if the BB lies completely outside the view frustum;<p>
<p><li> that all objects beneath it need to be displayed if the BB lies
completely inside the view frustum;<p>
<p><li> or, if the BB intersects the frustum, that the BB for the next level
down in the hierarchy needs to be checked.<p>
</ul><p><p></ul>
