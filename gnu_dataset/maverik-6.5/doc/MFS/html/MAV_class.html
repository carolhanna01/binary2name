<h2>Summary</h2>

Maverik class.

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
typedef struct {
  MAV_callbackFn fn[MAV_MAX_CBS][MAV_MAX_WIN];
} MAV_class;
</pre>
<p><hr>


<h2>Description</h2>

This data structure is described for information only. Users will
never directly access its contents, but it is hoped that by exposing
them users will gain an insight into how Maverik operates.<p>A Maverik class is simply an array of callback functions -- methods
which act upon the data structure associated with this class. Note that
callback functions are defined on a per class and per window
basis, thus allowing for the possibility of different behaviour in
different windows. For example, the draw callback for an object may cause
it to rendered filled in one window, and rendered in wire-frame in another
window.
