<h2>Summary</h2>

Textured object data.
<p><hr>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>
typedef struct {
  MAV_window *win;
  MAV_object *obj;
  MAV_callbackDrawFn fn;
  MAV_drawInfo di;
  MAV_drawInfo *dip;
  MAV_matrix mat;
} MAV_texturedObjData;
</pre>
<p><hr>


<h2>Description</h2>

On executing the draw callback for a textured object, the
<b>mav_texturedObjectsManage</b> function is called. This routine creates a
<tt>MAV_texturedObjData</tt> data structure for the object which contains all the
information necessary for it to be rendered at a later date: <tt>win</tt> is the window, <tt>obj</tt> is
the object, <tt>fn</tt> the draw callback function, <tt>di</tt> the drawing information to use, <tt>dip</tt> a pointer to <tt>di</tt> or
NULL if <tt>di</tt> is not defined, <tt>mat</tt> the state of the graphics matrix.<p><b><a href=mav_texturedObjectsManage.html>mav_texturedObjectsManage</a></b> maintains a list of these data structures
(which is reset at the start of each frame). <b>mav_texturedObjectsRender</b> is
called at the end of the frame to traverse this list rendering the
objects. Potentially this minimizes the context changes made by the
graphics pipe thus increasing performance.<p>This use of this feature is controlled by the option variable
<tt>mav_opt_delayTexture</tt> and is initially disabled.
