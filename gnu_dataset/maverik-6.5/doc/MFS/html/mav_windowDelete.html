<h2>Summary</h2>

Delete a window.
<p><hr>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p><b>void mav_windowDelete(MAV_window *w);</b>
<p><hr>


<h2>Description</h2>
This function closes the window <tt>w</tt>. <tt>w</tt> should
not be set <tt>mav_win_all</tt> or to the first window opened (you can't
delete the very first window opened since this has a load of OpenGL
state which other windows share). The functions <b><a href=mav_windowNew.html>mav_windowNew</a></b> and
<b><a href=mav_windowDelete.html>mav_windowDelete</a></b> are good for temporary pop up type windows.
