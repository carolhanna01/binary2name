<p><hr>

<p><li><b>int *info</b><br>

</ul>
<p><hr>


<h2>Description</h2>

Thus function checks the window event queue to see if any events are
outstanding. The window events that are trapped are key press/release,
mouse button press/release, window crossing, resize, mapping and
exposure. <p>If an event is waiting to be processed, it is removed from the queue
and details of that event are returned in <tt>info</tt>. The contents of <tt>info</tt>
are dependent on the event type and are trivially derived from the
source code to <b><a href=mav_gfxWM.html>mav_gfxWM</a></b>.<p>The function returns <tt>MAV_TRUE</tt> if an event was outstanding, <tt>MAV_FALSE</tt>
otherwise.
