<h2>Description</h2>

The keyboard event data structure, <tt>MAV_keyboardEvent</tt>, is passed to
the application supplied callback function, set with
the <b>mav_callbackKeyboardSet</b> function, upon keyboard events and details
that event. <p>
<ul><p><p><p><li> <tt>win</tt>
window in which event occurred.<p>
<p><li> <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>
position of mouse relative to window origin when event occured.<p>
<p><li> <tt>root_x</tt>, <tt>root_y</tt>
as (<tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>) but relative to root window<p>
<p><li> <tt>line</tt>
the line from the eye point through the world position of the
mouse when the keyboard event occured.<p>
<p><li> <tt>intersects</tt>
<tt>MAV_TRUE</tt> if line intersects an object, <tt>MAV_FALSE</tt> otherwise.<p>
<p><li> <tt>obj</tt>
the object intersected by the line (if any).<p>
<p><li> <tt>objint</tt>
the details of any object intersection.<p>
<p><li> <tt>key</tt>
The key pressed. Either this is the ASCII value of the key if printable or a hash defined value for keys such as the function and cursor keys. Note that non-ASCII symbols, such as the pound and euro signs, may not correctly interpreted.<p>
<p><li> <tt>modifiers</tt>
an array containing the status (<tt>MAV_PRESSED</tt> or <tt>MAV_RELEASED</tt>) of the
various keyboard modifiers (e.g. <tt>MAV_MODIFIER_SHIFT</tt>,
<tt>MAV_MODIFIER_CTRL</tt>, <tt>MAV_MODIFIER_ALT</tt>).<p>
<p><li> <tt>movement</tt>
<tt>MAV_PRESSED</tt> if key down event, <tt>MAV_RELEASED</tt> otherwise<p>
</ul><p>
The <tt>MAV_object</tt> which is passed as the first parameter to the event
callback function may well be different than <tt>obj</tt> stored in this data
structure since the former is always an object of the same type as the
callback was registered for. Therefore, event callbacks registered
for non-object classes such as <tt>mav_class_any</tt> will receive a dummy
object (in this case <tt>mav_object_any</tt>) as their first
parameters. No interpretation should be made of these objects by the
application. However, the <tt>obj</tt> field always contains the object
which the mouse was pointing at when the event occurred regardless of
how the callback function was registered.
