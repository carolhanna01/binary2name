<h2>Summary</h2>

Default object class ``composite''.

<h2>Description</h2>

A composite object is a number, <tt>numobj</tt>, of objects which are
first transformed by a common transformation matrix, <tt>matrix</tt>, before
being transformed by their individual transformation matrices. The objects
are defined as an array, <tt>obj</tt>, of pointers to Maverik
objects. Once defined, the objects comprising the composite objects
must remain static, i.e. changing the
number of objects in it, or any details of those objects, is
forbidden. And since the contents are static, a local coordinate frame
bounding box is stored in <tt>bb</tt> for efficiency.<p>Composite objects are not intended to be defined directly by an
application, but rather by functions such as <b>mav_compositeRead</b>,
which defines a composite object from a VRML97, Lightwave or AC3D format file.<p>If a composite object is selected via the usual mechanism then the
integer <tt>selobj</tt> holds the array element of the selected sub-object.
