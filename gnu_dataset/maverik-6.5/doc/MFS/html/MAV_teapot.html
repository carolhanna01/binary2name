<h2>Description</h2>

The classic computer graphics teapot without which no Virtual Environment is
complete. The teapot is orientated with its Y axis as ``up'' and the
spout pointing along the positive X axis. The teapot has an extent
<tt>size</tt> between the edge of the handle and the tip of the
spout. The bezier surfaces by which the teapot is defined are
subdivided <tt>subdivisions</tt> times when rendered (if greater than zero and 
<tt>mav_opt_curveLOD</tt> is not set).<p>The type of tea used to brew-up is governed by the enumerated constant
<tt>teabag</tt> which is set to either <tt>TETLEY</tt>, <tt>PG_TIPS</tt> or
<tt>EARL_GREY</tt>. The amount of sugar used is controlled by
<tt>lumps</tt>, in units of heaped teaspoons, and should be set to less
than 2 otherwise you'll get fat and rot your teeth.
