INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING GNUFDISK
==================================

This document explains how to build the gnufdisk package from source code.

Gnufdisk package depends on other packages, some of these are mandatory
others are optional. Required packages are: 
  
  * guile 
    
    Go to http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html and follow help.

Optional packages are:


BUILD FROM REPOSITORY SOURCE
----------------------------

After downloading the source code from the repository you need to rebuild the
configuration files. To do this run autoreconf:

  user@localhost:~/gnufdisk$ autoreconf

This command will run aclocal, automake, autoconf, etc.. 
Do not worry if you see a lot of messages, they are just notifications.

Now that you have the files you can run `configure'. I personally prefer to
start the configuration with some preset variables. In detail, I use these flags:

  * CPPFLAGS='-DGNUFDISK_DEBUG' 

    This flag causes the macro GNUFDISK_DEBUG be defined. 
    This macro enables support for debugging in gnufdisk.

  * CFLAGS='-g -ggdb -gdwarf-2 -Wall'

    These flags enable the debugging support into the compiled code (including
    extensions of GNU gdb) and enable all kinds of warning of gcc.

So the command to configure the package:

  user@localhost:~/gnufdisk$ CPPFLAGS='-DGNUFDISK_DEBUG' \
    CFLAGS='-g -ggdb -gdwarf-2 -Wall' ./configure

Now that the package is configured, you can compile it by running make:

  user@localhost:~/gnufdisk$ make

Now that the package is built and running you can decide to install it. If you
want to install the package into your computer you must run the command 
`make install' as root:

  user@localhost:~/gnufdisk$ sudo make install
  [sudo] password for user: 
  
If you want to improve the package gnufdisk you can start by reading the documentation.
To build the reference guide you can run the command `make doc', `make pdf', `make html' and so on:

  user@localhost:~/gnufdisk$ make doc

Happy hacking! :)

BUILD FROM PACKAGE
------------------

See `INSTALL'.
