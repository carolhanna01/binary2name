* vpopd - vpopd is a virtual POP3 daemon which redirects users to their real POP3 server (using the virtusertable); this way the POP3 service can be split across multiple POP3 servers.
* polyalphabetic substitution - This program encrypts and decrypts plaintext using different monoalphabetic substitutions as it proceeds through a plaintext message.
* Skill Literature - Skill Literature is a part of Logical Literature (lolit) and aims to teach children aged 4-10 to work with, and think about, different shapes. This pipeline game can only be won with sufficient insight, not speed.
* Math Literature - Math Literature is a part of Logical Literature (lolit) and aims to teach children aged 2-8 to calculate with positive numbers.
* UNFAIR - UNFAIR is a simple strategy game, where you are either attacking or defending a planet. Attacking troops can hide together to become stronger.
* gtkgo - The goal of the gtkgo project is to make a go game for both Linux and Windows, that has skin support and can load computer scripts that can be made by users, so that different go-computers can 'attack' each other or other users.
