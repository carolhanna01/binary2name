        * shmm.c (writemem): initialize length to 0 to prevent writing in memory of an empty string (shmm -s 0x00000001:0666:5 -w). In this case we are not in file_mode and we have data set to 0 so length value was depending on the builder to be initialized to 0 or not... If not we get a segfault when trying to access to data[x].

	* shmm.c (main): update check for permission syntax to be sure we get something like 0xxx with x like 0<=x<=7.
