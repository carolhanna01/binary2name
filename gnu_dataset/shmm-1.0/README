Bug reports:
 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
  and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

See README.dev for information on the shmm development environment --
any interested parties are welcome.  If you're a programmer and wish to
contribute, this should get you started.  If you're not a programmer,
you can still make significant contributions by writing test cases,
checking the documentation against the implementation, translating the
program strings to other languages, etc.

GNU shmm is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
