General Information
===================

This is Xlogmaster version 1.6.2. Xlogmaster is a program that
allows easy and flexible monitoring of everything that is going on on
your system - from reading logfiles over devices (/proc/...) to running
programs that gather status information in any way. It then allows you 
to set a lot of events based on certain activities in the monitored
entry and should prove very helpful for almost anyone.

For additional information and tutorial see the ./doc directory.
