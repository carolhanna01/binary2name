THE AS (ABSTRACT SYNTAX) CLASSES

These form the nodes of the abstract syntax tree created by the
parser.  They all subtype from $AS_NODE and correspond nearly
one-to-one with the grammatical productions in the specification.  The
AM_OUT class can be used to print any abstract syntax tree.  Some
useful abstractions are $AS_CLASS_ELT  (class elements), $AS_STMT
(statements) and $AS_EXPR (expressions).
