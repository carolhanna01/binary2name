COMPILER STAGES

These are code and any associated state that manipulates the vari ous
internal representations in the compiler.  They are abstracted so that
modules with differing functionality can be plugged in (for example, a
different back-end).  They are: $GET_OPTIONS, $PARSE, $FIND_TYPES,
$BUILD_TYPE_GRAPH, $CHECK_IFC_CONFORMANCE, $GET_MAIN, $GENERATE_AM,
$INLINE, $OPTIMIZE, $BACK_END, and $CHECK_AM.  Each of these has a
particular implementation in the compiler; for instance, CGEN is the C
generating $BACK_END.  CGEN and GET_OPTIONS have their own
subdirectories.
