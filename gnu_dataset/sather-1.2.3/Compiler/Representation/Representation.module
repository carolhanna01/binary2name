INTERNAL REPRESENTATION (other than AM and AS)

There are various tables and classes used by more than one stage of
compilation.  Most important is the PROG object, which is the central
registry for all globally visible tables and compiler stages.  Most
compiler components have a field that points to this object, from which
any other part of the compiler may be reached.
