CONFIGURATION

GET_OPTIONS: This is the standard options module for the Sather
compiler. It is meant to be included in classes which specialize for a
particular configuration, and handles all the options needed by any
tool built using the compiler components - the location of the library
home, getting file names, interpreting command files.  A browser, for
example, might include this and then define additional options
appropriate to browsing.

CODE_OPTIONS: This adds options needed for anything that generates
code; it han dles optional checking flags such as "-pre" and
"-no_pre".

CS_OPTIONS: This adds options specific to the compiler.  It also reads
in the file "System/CONFIG".
