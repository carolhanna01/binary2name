Changes for 1.2.1:

    The names of the executables have been changed:
	cs   -> sacomp
	bs   -> sabrowse
	cspp -> saprep
    I'm sorry if this causes inconveniences. It was clear that the short
    names as we had them before would most certainly cause a name clash 
    some day. Changing the names will only get more difficult as time goes
    on, so changing it now was the best decision.
