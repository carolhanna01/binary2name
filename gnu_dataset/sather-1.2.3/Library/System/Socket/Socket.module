-- SOCKET provides bidirectional communication of STRs between two
-- Sather programs running either on the same machine, or across  
-- the Internet.                                                 

-- This requires System support for link flags. Look at the
-- module file in $SATHER_HOME/System/Platforms/unix/Platform.module
-- and $SATHER_HOME/System/Platforms/solaris/Platform.module
