Here you find a new version of the Socket library, from the team
in Waikato, New Zealand. It does work for Win32, but it may or may not
do so for other Platforms, which I could not find out.
Anybody with experience and/or interest in checking it is welcome to test it and
come up with a portable solution covering all platforms, (perhaps a combination
of the two versions)
