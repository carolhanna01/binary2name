(*
   Historical baggage. Use these F classes only within a class - never 
expose them outside a class boundary.

	These are high-performance workhorse Sather classes,
FLIST, FMAP, FSET and FQSET which use amortised doubling.  The "F"
prefix denotes fast. They have slightly awkward interfaces requiring 
writebacks, i.e.
    myset := myset.insert(foo);

Although this appears to be a value-oriented interface, the 'myset'
returned may actually be the same as the 'myset' on the right side (in
fact, it usually will be.)  This is done for absolute speed (the 'F'
stands for 'fast'.)  We suggest that they be avoided by novices and
should certainly not be used in class interfaces (i.e. their use
should be intra-class).

--  Many of these have no single abstraction
