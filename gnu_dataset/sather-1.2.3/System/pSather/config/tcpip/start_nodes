# define here how to start the different nodes. Note that
# "primary nide" is already running and should NOT be started 
# here. The number of nodes to run is passed into this 
# script as the first parameter. The second paramter
# is the program to start on each node (this may be an
# absolute pathname or a relative pathname), and the
# rest are the arguments for this program
#
# In addition to staring up the processes on remote clusters,
# the script sets an environment variable "SECONDARY_CLUSTER" 
# on remote nodes to let the new processes know that they
# where started by this script rather than directlty. Only
# a "primary cluster" (the one that calls start_nodes) doesn't
# have "SECONDARY_CLUSTER" set. This functionality is necessary
# as in most cases we need to do slightly different things
# for the primary and secondary nodes.
