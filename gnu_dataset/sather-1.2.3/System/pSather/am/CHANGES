0.02	first released version

0.03	- fixed some bugs (typing errors) in the macros for Solaris threads
	- added file THREADS

0.04	- added this file
	- thr_set_signal_handler returns now the previous signal handler
	- Solaris: CNTR_DECR and CNTR_INCR are now immune against signals.
	           This was needed to prevent dead locks.
	- added cntr_incr_by() and cntr_decr_by().
	- blocked signal during execution of am_request_N, ....  
	- changed the waitcntr definition for solaris, to allow more than
	  one waitcntr per block

0.05:   - fixed a race condition in waits (in the lwp-package).
	- removed a bogus assert from lockl (in the lwp-package).
	- added the function    char *thr_print_id(thread_t,char *)
	- all messages sent to "am_my_proc()" are executed directly,
	  which makes local communication much faster.

0.06	- fixed thr_create_df(), which was broken if used to create a
          thread on the local node.
	- fixed a compilation warning

0.07	- Added support for networks of workstations connected over TCP/IP.
          This was done by using TAM (TCP/IP Active Messages), a library
	  originally written by Lok Tin Liu at the University of Berkeley
	  See the file tcpam.c for more information.
	  The tcpam.c file has been adapted to be MT-safe and the interface
	  was changed to make it compatible to the other am calls
	  used for solaris and sun. Unfortunately the TCP/IP code
	  works only under Solaris.
