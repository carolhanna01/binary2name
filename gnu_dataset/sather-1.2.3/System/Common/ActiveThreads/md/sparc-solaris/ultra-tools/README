This directory contains a simple utility for UltraSPARCs that
reports the secondary cache statistics (provided the PIC control
regsiter is set accordingly - a prerequisite)

Note that this is a _very_ simple utility. Overflows are not
handled properly. The instrumentation counters are 32 bit only,
so they overflow ater a while - be careful.
