#ifndef _MD_ATOMIC_
#define _MD_ATOMIC_


/* 
   Until better times (when I have time to look into the multiprocessing
   version), we do not really need atomic operations here. The only trouble
   can come from DMA, but we do not allow this. Active Threads have to be
   called specifically for synchronization. 

   This will be replaced with proper atomic operations when we have a
   true multiprocessing version of Active Threads for MIPS/IRIX
