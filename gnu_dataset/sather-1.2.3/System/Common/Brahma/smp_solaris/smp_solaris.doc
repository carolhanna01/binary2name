"smp_solaris" is a reference platform of Brahma, using Solaris threads
and Sparc v7 spinlocks.  If the number of clusters passed to BR_init is
zero, is checks the env variable "CLUSTERS"; if not there, it uses one
cluster.  All operations are really local although they have remote
semantics.

Define "BR_SMP_SOLARIS" to use this Brahma platform.
