-- X platform module
-- Specifies paths where various X libraries may be found
-- Gui, DualGui and the Browser all rely on these paths
-not_a_real_platform

-C_flag -I/usr/X11R6/include/X11/      	-- Expected to contain X11/ headers
-- -C_flag -lm

-C_flag -L/usr/X11R6/lib/           -- Expected to contain libX11.a
-C_flag -lX11 



-- If setting these -L flags does not work correctly, it might be
-- because your version of gcc has some built-in paths which over-ride
-- these paths.  If this is the case, try modifying the platform module
-- itself.  For instance, you could change 
--  -C_flag -ltk 
-- to:
--  -C_flag /usr/local/X11/lib/libtk.a
-- Likewise, you could change the paths to header files, but these are
-- harder to find. The -H flag in gcc can be useful for debugging
