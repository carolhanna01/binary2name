-- Active Thread stuff currently uses GCC's "inline" functions which
-- work properly only with gcc optimizations on. However, using just
-- -O breaks gcc in another place (the bug has been reported). I guess
-- this supports what many others already know: gcc is most reliable
-- with -O2 and higher. We use -O2 for Active Threads for now (always)
