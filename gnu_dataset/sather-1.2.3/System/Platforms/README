The whole structure for platforms needs a complete revision yet. Just some information on
what we have right now:

A platform directory there may be several special files:

Makefile
	used for making and cleaning up everything needed to use the platform
	there is a special target "boot", used to make the bootcompiler on that
	platform.
	
CONFIG
	configuration information additional to System/Common/CONFIG

Make.target.inc
	If this file is present, it is included at the beginning of the Makefile
	that is created in the .code directory of a Sather compilation. It may be used
	set some variables which then can be made use of in $(...) constructs. See TclTk
	for an example.
	Also used in bogus platforms

Platform.module
	A normal .module file that may name any additional .sa .c or .o files or additional
	CFLAGS for the compilation of programs.
	Careful: $(...) expressions are replaced by the contents of a environment
	variable if there is one present. Otherwise, they are kept verbatim.

header.h
	This is included in the sather.h file in a .code directory. Not used in bogus platforms.
