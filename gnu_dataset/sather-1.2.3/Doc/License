The sather package is distributed under a combination of the GPL and the LGPL.
(See the corresponding Files in this directory) The Library and everything that is
linked to a executable written in Sather, is placed under the LGPL, which allows
you to also use them for proprietary programs and distribute the created code under
your own conditions.

The compiler, the browser and any accompanying files are placed under the GPL, which means
that any code including portions of this will have to be distributed under GPL itself.
