If you found a bug in the Sather/pSather compiler, the library or somewhere else
in this package, send an email with the following information to

	bug-sather@gnu.org

We need to know:
	- version of the Sather compiler 
	  you can use -V or -version compiler option to find out the version
	- The exact command line you used to compile your program
	  (including a copy of all the module files you used)
        - A description of the error
	- If the problem shows up in a small Sather program,
	  send it too, but please don't send more than about 200
	  lines of Sather code. If we need it, we will ask you for it.
	- The Hardware and Operating System used to compile the program

There are other files we may possibly use, but please send them only 
on demand. Some of those files are:
	$SATHER_HOME/Makefile
	$SATHER_HOME/System/Common/CONFIG
