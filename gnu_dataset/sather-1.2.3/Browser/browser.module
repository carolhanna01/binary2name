(*
Sather Source Browser
---------------------

This browser is based on the tkKit interface to Tcl and Tk and on the
Sather compiler. browser.sa is a simple interface to the compiler that
runs the front end of the compiler and then sets up the tk callbacks.
In addition, browser.sa provides a uniform interface to the compiler s
many tables and extracts the necessary information.  The tcl part
browser.tcl then generates the user interface and accesses whatever
information it needs from the browser through callbacks.  Please see
the various help files in the Browser subdirectory (Help/)

-- NOTE: Some errors are generated when compiling unreachable code,
-- since the "dummy" compiler classes (in dummy_compiler.sa)
-- don't have some of the necessary functions.
