Class List
==========
This pane shows a list of all classes in the system.

Classes are grouped according to the modules in which they are found.
Each group of classes has a module separator.  Clicking (button 1) on
a class brings that class into context - it displays the appropriate
graph, updates the routine list and displays the class definition
text.  

Clicking (button 1) on a module will display that module and the
appropriate graph.  

Clicking (button 2) on a class will display a "documented" version
of the class with only signatures and comments.

Clicking (button 2) on a module will toggle whether the module
is expanded or not. The list of unexpanded modules is stored in
the configuration file ~/.bsConfig.tcl whenever the configuration 
is stored.


Implementation
--------------
The implementation may be found in browserClassList.tcl

Public
------
classListCreate
	Creates the main panes in the frame (gClassListFrame). The main
	pane is called .l and is a text pane
classListInit
	Initialize elements in {gClassListFrame}.l to be the current
	set of visible modules and their classes.
classListUpdate
	Redisplay, based on the currently selected class


Tags
----
Each class has the following tags
	class               [used for setting fonts, colors etc.]
	${cl}               [the class name - 	
                            bound with key 1 to "updateForClass ${cl} false"
                            and with key 2 to   "updateForClass ${cl} true"]
Each module has the following tags
	module                [ used for selecting colors/fonts]
	${textNameForModule}  [last module file name, bound to:
                 		"updateForClass ${module} false"  
				where ${module} is the path]
