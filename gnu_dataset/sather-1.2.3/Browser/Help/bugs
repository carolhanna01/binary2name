Bugs
====
GDB, Garbage Collection and Tk
------------------------------	
A note from the tkSather distribution that might be relevant:
> NOTE:
> =====
> If you use the garbage collected version of Sather you will need to
> make sure you link tcl/tk with the Sather garbage collector.  This
> requires changes to tcl/tcl.h, tcl/Makefile.in, tk/Makefile.in

I've not yet done this; as it stands, I cannot use gdb with the
browser - it dies somewhere during the first garbage collect.  It
might be possible to fix this by recompiling tk and tcl to use the
boehm collector.  I don't know why this would only cause problems when
gdb is being used, though.

General
-------
* The browser is my first tcl program - it started out as a working
  example as I was trying to learn tcl.  I now realize that the style is
  pretty bad, but I did not know what conventions would work when I
  started out. I've tried to clean things up as far as possible. It is
  full of globals, many of which are required by tcl, and others which
  arose out of laziness. See implementation

Viewing features
----------------
* Currently, all concrete classes will show _all_ routines (i.e. a
  flattened version of the class). All abstract types show only the
  routines in that particular abstract class.  This is because of
  differences in the manner in which abstract and concrete classes are
  represented in the compiler, and probably will not be changed (fixed!)
  anytime soon.


Viewing the Graph
-----------------
* Most bugs are connected with scaling and moving around the graph
  pane. It seems to work ok now.  proc graphReCenter needs fixing
* $OB is over nothing - that's just how the compiler has it set up.
  It probably should not be displayed.
