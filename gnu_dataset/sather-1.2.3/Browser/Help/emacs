Emacs support
=============
	The browser now has some support for the use of emacs through
the emacsclient program. There is a menu item under the text menu 
indicating whether an emacs buffer should be used. To use emacs
in an existing emacs buffer run 
M-x server-start
and choose the "emacs" menu item from the text menu.
You may need to (load "server.el") to get this to work in your .emacs

	Browsing should now take you to the appropriate location
in the emacs buffer. 
	
	There is a problem which Kevin has been working on - that
emacs wants you to explicitly terminate an interaction with C-x #,
which quickly becomes a pain for quick browsing. I believe he will
have a patch to server.el in the new sather-lib.el which should fix
it.  However, if the problem still occurs (too many hanging clients)
you should hit C-x # before moving on to browse something else in
emacs. Otherwise, hanging emacsclient processes will build up and
eventually render your emacs unusable!

	emacsclient must also be from the same generation as the
emacs you are using....
