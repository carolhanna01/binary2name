	This browser has benefitted from feedback from Michael
Philippsen, David Bailey, Claudio Fliener and Mark Boldstadt.

	David Stoutamire has been directly involved in creating the
browser - he provided many of the central ideas, the necessary
compiler support and some tcl code, including the comment
highlighting.  He is also responsible for toning down the color scheme
from my own, much more gaudy, choices!

Matt Kennel provided improved color support (consistent colors between
 different windows)
 Proper flushing of events
 Cursor changes to reflect busy states
 A different window configuration with the graph window separate

Holger Klawitter
  Provided the neat icon
  Identified several bugs
  Suggestion for the history mechanism

Kevin 
   Has changed server.el to behave in the way we want it to...

Yon Uriarte provided
  Improved layout of 1 layer graphs
  The ability to hide C_ and TEST_ classes
