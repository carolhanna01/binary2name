Text Window
===========

The text window supports primitive editing (no cursor movement except
with the mouse!).  If someone has a set of default bindings for a text
widget, I'll be happy to incorporate them.

	The current bindings are emacs-like for primitive
movement. Control-d does not cut the current selection. I've
explicitly disallowed it since the default binding generates errors if
nothing is selected.  The default binding is set in the startup file
for tk (tk.tcl) which is sourced by startup.tcl)

Save button:
	It is possible to save modified files by clicking on the save
button.  If the variable safeFile is set to true in browser.tcl, then
a backup version of the original file will be retained as
<originalfile>.safetybackup

It is also possible to browse using emacs (but there are still problems).
See the file help.emacs or the emacs option on the help menu.


Implementation
--------------
	The implementation is in the file browserText.tcl

	version of the class (textShowClassDocs), if false, show the
	class definition (textShowClassDef)
textReadFileLoadText (title, filename, line, modifiable?)
	Determines whether to use emacs. If not, reads text from file
	(if the file has changed) - auxGetAllFile,  
	Load text into text window - textLoadText
	Highlight the selected line - textGotoLine
	Change title color - textChangeTitleColor
	Called by help and other routines 

textSaveTextIfNecc
	Called by quit and whenever a file changes, to determine whether the
current file must be saved. Queries user

Tags
----
	If comment/class highlighting is on, the following tags
are used
comment	 Indicates a comment line

Private functions
-----------------
