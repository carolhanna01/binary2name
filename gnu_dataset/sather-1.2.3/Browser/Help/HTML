Generating HTML
---------------
	I've used the browser to generate the HTML versions of the Sather
libraries that are accessible from 
http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/~gomes/Sather/Library/index.html
	This is done by using programs Bin/gen_html and Bin/shortflat
These programs must be invoked on a single module file and will run
the browser in non-interactive mode (sabrowse -non_interactive <tcl-script>)
to generate a largish file called gen_bs_info_raw_dump.tcl in the
current directory. gen_html then runs a bunch of scripts that are
in Browser/Web which use the dumped information to generate
a large number of web pages: 1 per class + 1 per file + a few more
in the current directory. The top level file is
"index.html" which is an HTML index to the other files.
