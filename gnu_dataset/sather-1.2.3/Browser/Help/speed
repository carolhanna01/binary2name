Faster Execution
=================
Some suggestions:
1) Turn off comment highlighting (text menu).  You can also set the
   threshold file size for highlighting comments to a smaller value
   also in the text menu. These options may be saved.
2) Turn off graph updating (in the graph menu) for purely textual
   browsing
3) For faster startup, use the option -use_has, which will cause
   prevent parsing of Library classes that are not reachable from your
   "main" class.

Implementation note: Faster Debugging of the Browser itself
-----------------------------------------------------------
	In order to debug/make changes to the browser it is frequently
useful to be able to re-run the browser quickly. The way I do this is
by the following:

> setenv SATHER_LIBRARY /usr/local/lang/sather/Browser/testlib.sa

	The file testlib.sa contains dummy definitions for all the
built-in classes. (INT, $OB etc.) and works just fine, provided you
browse classes that do not make use of any special routines in these
classes.  Then run the browser on

> sabrowse test2.module

	This consists of simple test classes that do not make any use
of particular routines, but is usually sufficient to test out any
change you've made. The compiler may give you some errors about 
duplicate definitions, but the browser will fire up all the same.
