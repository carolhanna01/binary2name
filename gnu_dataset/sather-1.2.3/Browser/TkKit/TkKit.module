(*

	This is the bare-bones Tk<->Sather Interface by Matthias Ernst.  Some
documentation is in the doc directory. This interface is used by the
Browser, but not by the Gui. The Gui uses a further stripped down version 
of these classes.

Installation
------------
	See the installation notes in Doc/Installation
Briefly - ensure that the tcltk platform works correctly


Trying it out
-------------
....

Any questions or comments should go to: 
bug-sather@gnu.org and also to Matthias Ernst
