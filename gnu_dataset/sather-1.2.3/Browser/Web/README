This is just a whole mess of scripts:

For genererating standard HTML (with dot graphs).
-------------------------------------------------
Browser/Web/gen_html:
	invokes: A) sabrowse with Browser/Web/dump-pre-html-dot
                 B) Browser/Web/gen_dot
               	    B1) Browser/Web/gen_html_top_level
			(to generate the main file index.html etc.)
		    B2) Browser/Web/gen_html_class_index
			  (to generate the list of classes)
		    B3) Browser/Web/gen_html_shortflat
			  (to generate the short flat listings)
		    B4) Browser/Web/gen_html_sa_files
			  (to generate the actual, lined sather files)
To generate graphs using dot (the rest will work even  if this last step fails)
                    B5) Browser/Web/gr2gif (or gr2jpg)
			(to generate the dotty gif (or jpeg) files)

(A) dumps a file "gen_bs_info_raw_dump.tcl" which has all the
    information needed by the (B2-5) scripts as well as .gr files
    for each of the abstract classes, which is used by B1

(B4) makes use of a list of relevant files that is generated by
	(B3) in the file named gen_files_from_shortflat
	(if it is not found, it will make use of class locations which
	may miss some files)

(B5) relies on the program "dot" being installed. This program is
available for free from AT&T for non-commerical uses, but they
do not permit us to distribute it
   http://www.research.att.com:80/orgs/ssr/book/reuse/
under the binary for graph visualization.

We use the program dot which is available (free) from
   http://www.research.att.com:80/orgs/ssr/book/reuse/

Look under Binary for graph visualization.  It is available for free,
but cannot be redistributed by ICSI (they want you to agree to some terms).


Files used to generate the html versions of a sather module.
These classes are invoked indirectly from ../../Bin/gen_html

common_funcs:	Source by other tcl files for some basic functions
dump_pre_html_info:  The browser is run in non-interactive mode with this
	script in order to generate the file gen_bs_info_raw_dump.tcl
	which is source by "common_funcs"


gen_html_from_data: 	Generate the top level file index.html and
	source the foll. files that generate the other panes.
gen_html_class_index: 	Generate the class listing pane
gen_html_shortflat:  	Generate the short flat listing of the classes
gen_html_sa_files:	Generate for each sather file a prettified html file
