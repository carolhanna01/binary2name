Known bugs
----------
- gen_html_shortflat: does not handle multi-line function or class definitions
- gen_html_shortflat: private attributes are mentioned twice (both reader 
	and writer)
- gen_html_short_flat: multiple attributes on one line are mentioned 
	multiple times

With alternative table-per-routine version this bug does not arise
	 gen_html_short_flat: long routine definitions are not properly divided


Suggestions:
------------
- Sort features based on file locations instead of routine names
- Choice of views - separate view for the class graph
