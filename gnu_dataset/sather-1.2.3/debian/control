Description: Sather compiler
 Compiler and programming environment for Sather:
 Sather is an object oriented language which designed to be simple,
 efficient, safe, and non-proprietary. It aims to meet the needs of
 modern research groups and to foster the development of a large,
 freely available, high-quality library of efficient well-written
 classes for a wide variety of computational tasks. It was originally
 based on Eiffel but now incorporates ideas and approaches from several
 languages. One way of placing it in the "space of languages" is to say
 that it attempts to be as efficient as C, C++, or Fortran, as elegant
 and safe as Eiffel or CLU, and to support higher-order functions as
 well as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Smalltalk.
