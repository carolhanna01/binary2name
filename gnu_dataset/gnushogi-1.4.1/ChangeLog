2014-01-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/init-common.c, gnushogi/pattern-common.c: Add missing
	copyright info to *-common.c, added by the minishogi patches.

2014-01-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/pattern.c: Adjust comment to prevent licensecheck from
	considering pattern.c as generated

2014-01-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

2014-01-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.texi: Doc: more on shogi variants in general, and
	Mini Shogi in particular.

2014-01-12  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Bump version to "1.4.1-rc1+".

2013-12-18  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Makefile.in: Fix "make distclean" when there is no editor backup
	file to remove.

2013-12-18  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* NEWS, configure.ac: Prepare v1.4.1rc1.

2013-12-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* .gitignore, Makefile.in, configure.ac,
	misc/mkmakefile.mingw-on-cygwin, win32/config.h.in: Add build
	support for win32 on cygwin (gcc3).

2013-12-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* README.maint, TODO, configure.ac, gnushogi/Makefile.profile.in: 
	Get rid of Makefile.profile, document flags to use in README.maint
	instead.  We don't want to maintain Makefile.profile as a quasi-copy of main
	Makefile, that's not a good practice at all.

2013-12-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/pat2inc.c: Kill dead code in pat2inc.

2013-12-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/makepattern.c, gnushogi/pat2inc.c, gnushogi/pattern.c: 
	Minor pat2inc code cleanups

2013-12-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in: Drop useless defines for pat2inc build.

2013-12-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/{gnushogi.texinfo => gnushogi.texi}: Use
	.texi suffix, preferred to .texinfo.

2013-12-16  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in: Fix ordering of include dirs.  Local headers first, then build dir, then src dir.

2013-12-16  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Makefile.in: Minor makefile improvements

2013-12-15  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/opts.h: Move into opts.h the "mostly for hacking" remark
	from INSTALL file.

2013-12-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* .gitignore: Update .gitignore for doc/ dir.

2013-12-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c: #define _POSIX_C_SOURCE to get proper access
	to snprintf and vsnprintf.

2013-12-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Use POSIX setvbuf in preference
	to BSD setlinebuf.  This avoids implicit declaration of setlinebuf with GNU libc, which
	would have required to define _BSD_SOURCE just to get rid of, and is
	not an innocuous setting.  Drop call to no-op AC_FUNC_SETVBUF_REVERSED at the same time.

2013-12-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Fully quote autoconf macro arguments, as they
	should.

2013-12-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Bump version to "1.4.1-rc0+".

2013-12-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/Makefile.in: Generate HTML doc using makeinfo, instead of
	obsolecent texi2html

2013-11-07  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* NEWS, README, configure.ac: Prepare v1.4.1rc0.

2013-11-07  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.texinfo: Update manual for maintainer, project
	communication, and plans.

2013-11-07  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* TODO: Update TODO: there are plans for v1.5, and things have been
	done.

2013-11-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Makefile.in: Fix "make dist" not to include a recursive copy of
	the dist.

2013-11-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.texinfo: Fix formatting of boards in texinfo doc.

2013-11-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* NEWS: Update NEWS file for upcoming 1.4.1.

2013-11-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.6: Remove version number from manpage.  It was not very useful there, and has been out of sync with the
	software version anyway.

2013-11-05  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Makefile.in, gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/Makefile.profile.in,
	xshogi/Makefile.in: Remove unused obsolete version numbers from
	Makefiles.

2013-10-20  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* TODO: Take note of more cleanups to do.

2013-10-20  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, gnushogi/Makefile.in: Move hashfile definition from
	configure.ac into Makefile.in Like other similar defs...

2013-10-20  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* .gitignore, Makefile.in, configure.ac, gnushogi/Makefile.in,
	misc/gnuminishogi.tbk: Use configure --enable-minishogi to select
	build of gnuminishogi.  At the same time, provide an empty gnuminishogi.tbk so things work
	more as they should.  Only the patterns are still necessary to specify manually at this
	point.

2013-09-27  H.G. Muller <h.g.muller@hccnet.nl>

	* gnushogi/eval.c: Fix mini-Shogi out-of-bounds acces of board

2011-09-29  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/eval.c: Avoid looking at the game type to determine
	minishogi piece values.  We don't know how to determine the game type anyway, and a previous
	patch disables its computation, but no need to compile dead code in
	this case.  Another problem to look at is that "in_opening_stage" is surely
	badly tuned for MiniShogi, but the program seems to score better
	with current code that by telling there is opening stage.  Flag FIXME's where applicable so some willing soul would know where
	to find things to improve for MiniShogi.

2011-09-28  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/eval.c: Disable GuessGameType() for MiniShogi.  Game types for MiniShogi are surely different from the ones in
	Shogi, so this would require serious thought to get it right.  Just
	pretend we don't know.

2011-09-28  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/eval.c: Fix ScorePosition() for MiniShogi.  Gcc's stack-smashing protection combined with glibc's
	-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE detected with a segfault that we were using
	9x9-board offsets on our 5x5 board.  This patch abstracts the
	relevant hardcoded constants and provides correct values for
	MiniShogi.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* TODO, gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/init-common.c,
	gnushogi/init.c, gnushogi/makepattern.c, gnushogi/pat2inc.c,
	gnushogi/pattern-common.c, gnushogi/pattern.c,
	gnushogi/pattern.inc, misc/gnuminishogi.pat: Generate patterns.inc
	at build time.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* TODO, gnushogi/attacks.c, gnushogi/commondsp.c,
	gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/eval.c, gnushogi/genmove.c,
	gnushogi/globals.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/init.c: Initial
	attempt at minishogi.  This preliminar minishogi takes the approach of conditional
	compilation, so I can focus on differences between shogi and
	minishogi.  Those ifdef's are expected to progressively disappear as
	the support code is made generic enough to support the needs of both
	variants.

2013-10-20  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Makefile.in, configure.ac, doc/{Makefile => Makefile.in},
	gnushogi/Makefile.in: Fix various regression for building out of
	tree.  Most notably, doc was never buildable out of tree, but the recent
	build enhancements did not take that into account.

2013-09-27  H.G. Muller <h.g.muller@hccnet.nl>

	* gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/init.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Windows
	port This patch makes GNU Shogi compilable with gcc under Cygwin, using
	the -mno-cygwin flag, so that it can run as a native Windows
	application, independent of Cygwin1.dll.  The patch is fully conditional, based on defined(WIN32).  YD: rebased onto recent refactorings

2013-11-03  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Normalize configure --help using AS_HELP_STRING.

2013-11-03  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Don't bail out if configure (without --with-curses)
	does not find libcurses.  Only fail when --with-curses was requested and libcurses cannot be
	found.

2013-11-03  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/Makefile.profile.in: Fix funny
	search-and-replace copyright typo.

2013-11-03  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/commondsp.c,
	gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/main.c,
	gnushogi/pat2inc.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c, gnushogi/sizetest.c,
	version.h, xshogi/Makefile.in, xshogi/xshogi.c: Use centralized
	version from configure.ac, drop use of separate patchlevel.

2013-11-03  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/book.c, gnushogi/commondsp.c,
	gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/globals.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h,
	gnushogi/init.c, gnushogi/main.c, gnushogi/pat2inc.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.c, gnushogi/search.c, gnushogi/util.c,
	misc/gnushogi.lng: Move strings back into source code, from .lng
	support.  * there is no point in translating the protocol * if someone wants to translate the curses UI, this should be done
	  with gettext

2013-10-23  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h,
	gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.h,
	gnushogi/tcontrl.c: Move ElapsedTime to tcontrl.c, now that there is
	a single implementation.

2013-10-23  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h, gnushogi/search.c: Make UpdateClocks and
	input-polling dspwrappers-based too.  Those things are the only thing called from ElapsedTime() to be
	different between Curses and Raw/X, and were not abstracted yet.  The poll-based polling code was not called from within
	ElapsedTime(), which made it less frequently called, but that did
	not seem to be a problem.  And it was redundant in Curses mode with
	the FIONREAD call.

2013-10-22  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Fix regression with stdarg dspwrappers.  1be442641b610fa1b6172a38d9acffe2d22797b6 and
	3f589711eb3ecc7644378d6a0f2f29bc4b4c7db9 are both broken, passing
	the va_list inside another va_list to poor unsuspecting backend
	implementations.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/makepattern.c: Fixed minor regression in makepatter.  In 6cdb4afe21c8d0eb740a6a22a02a0adf922fddfc, I messed up a
	conditional causing an error message to be written even when we did
	find a pattern file.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h: Fix build of
	--with-curses mode.  Broken by 6030715dffdadf4402dccf6a8bf9966cfab2be1d and not checked
	soon enough :(

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c: Drop non-curses support from
	Curses_ElapsedTime.  Similar to 58e443e7ec0d834fe75a9eda53f4cfaf7f8b106c, was a remnant
	from before 4a9acd2e4d21586f2af629ec44cd78c237dcd702.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/makepattern.c: Drop NOT_CURSES occurences from
	makepattern.  Why on earth are we supposing that pat2inc would run in Curses mode
	one day ?

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Convert more stuff from #ifdef to dspwrappers:
	SetupBoard.  Not a very big problem since that function is not curses-only this
	time, but raw-only.  But this is the natural continuation of the
	"nuke NOT_CURSES" movement.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h, gnushogi/gnushogi.h: 
	Stop exporting Curses-internal functions to everyone.  Possible since cursesdsp is now self-contained.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, gnushogi/Makefile.in: Finish the --without-curses
	support.  Now that all the silly problems refering to Curses-specific
	functions from unrelated places are all solved, we can spare linking
	cursesdsp when not required.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Remove dead Curses-specific code from
	Raw_ElapsedTime()

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/search.c: Remove useless explicit prototype for pow().

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/Makefile.profile.in,
	gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h, gnushogi/dspwrappers.c,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h, gnushogi/sysdeps.c: Change ElapsedTime to a
	normal display function.  The FIONREAD version is clearly tied to Curses, and the NOFIONREAD
	works corectly with xshogi/xboard as well as Raw.  No reason for a
	separate mechanism.  --without-curses now builds as expected.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Make spacing consistent
	in *dsp.c, kill unused global hidden between funcs.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/sysdeps.c: Factorize ElapsedTime implementations by
	restricting HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY #ifdef's.  (and take the best-looking one on cosmetic differences)

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h,
	gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Fix
	ShowPrompt implementation across display drivers.

2013-10-17  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Convert more stuff from #ifdef to dspwrappers:
	GetString.  Thin function is the first non-void one and shows the limits of the
	current macro set.  Let's consider this stuff to be temporary.  At least it finally allows to drop #include <curses.h> from
	commondsp.

2013-10-16  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Convert more stuff from #ifdef to dspwrappers:
	AlwaysShowMessage.

2013-10-16  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Provide a Raw version of ShowNodeCnt to avoid
	more #ifdef's.  At the same time, nuking "#ifdef DYNAMIC_ZNODES" (dead code).

2013-10-16  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c: When in check, complain with the requested
	move.  Looks like in xshogi mode we were complaining by explicitly using
	the algebraic notation, but apparently noone forces us to do so.

2013-10-15  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Add safeguard against buffer overflow when
	calling scanf.

2013-10-15  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.h: Convert more stuff from #ifdef to dspwrappers.

2013-10-19  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Configure: stop abusing AC_MSG_CHECKING, use correct
	idioms.

2013-10-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/init.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	xshogi/xshogi.c: Finally get rid of that highly non-standard use of
	SIGINT.  People will at last be able to Ctrl-C gnushogi :)

2013-10-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/search.c: Regularly check for user input when searching,
	to have a chance to catch EOF from engine.  When an engine quits without terminating a searching gnushogi, it
	would continue to search and never realize there was no reason to
	continue.  This is a poll-based implementation of what H.G.Muller wrote for
	WIN32 to circumvent the lack of UNIX signals there.

2013-10-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Detect EOF waiting for
	user input in xshogi and raw modes, and trigger exit.  No idea why the raw implementation of ExitShogi() did not call
	exit().  Even after detecting EOF, we were thrown into a tight
	loop...

2013-10-13  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/init.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	xshogi/xshogi.c: Restore SIGINT for stopping gnushogi when thinking.  SIGINT is unfortunately part of the protocol inherited from
	gnuchess4, and is used by xboard as such.  So this was not a proper
	fix for the original issue.  This reverts commit 00e10bc4a760150665436b17c50abf264f28d435, "Don't
	intercept INT and QUIT signals, and use USR1 instead of QUIT for".

2013-10-14  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Rename configure --with-xshogi to --enable-xshogi
	for correctness.

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Makefile.in, configure.ac: Start of a "make dist" target.  The old one uses a script that was never published...

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* .gitignore, Makefile.in, doc/Makefile, doc/gnushogi.html,

	doc/gnushogi_9.html, doc/gnushogi_abt.html, doc/gnushogi_ovr.html,
	doc/gnushogi_toc.html, doc/texinfo.tex: Rework doc-handing make
	rules and remove generated files from version control.  Newer texinfo.tex was imported from texinfo 5.1.

	* doc/Makefile, doc/make_fig1, doc/make_fig2: Remove hack previously
	used to insert diags into generated HTML.  Useless since db5c540ff7e9dd176f797b50031141e2c2059456.

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* autogen.sh: Don't cause autogen.sh to run configure.

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog, README.maint: Initiate new ChangeLog using git2cl.

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog => ChangeLog.old, NEWS: Start to fill NEWS, rotate
	pre-git logs to ChangeLog.old.

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.texinfo: Critical texinfo doc formatting fixes.  * "@sp 1" everywhere look ugly today * ASCII rendering of boards requires @verbatim

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.texinfo: Use @ifnotex and not @ifinfo, or HTML does
	not get its ToC.

2013-10-08  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* doc/gnushogi.texinfo: Remove text of the GPL (v2) from texinfo
	doc, it did not format any more though TeX.

2013-09-30  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in, xshogi/Makefile.in: Honor LDFLAGS at
	link-time.

2013-09-29  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac, gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h,
	gnushogi/main.c: Allow configure --without-curses.  Not finding libcurses was surely causing problems, we now also
	proceed cleanly in that case.

2013-09-29  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/dspwrappers.c: Remove excessive boilerplate duplication
	from dspwrappers.

2013-09-29  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* .gitignore: Add .gitignore file

2013-09-29  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* configure.ac: Clarify configure options that only relate to xshogi

2013-10-03  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/Makefile.profile.in,
	gnushogi/attacks.c, gnushogi/book.c, gnushogi/book.h,
	gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.h,
	gnushogi/debug.h, gnushogi/dspwrappers.c, gnushogi/dspwrappers.h,
	gnushogi/eval.c, gnushogi/eval.h, gnushogi/genmove.c,

	gnushogi/pat2inc.c, gnushogi/pattern.c, gnushogi/pattern.h,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.h, gnushogi/search.c,
	gnushogi/sizetest.c, gnushogi/sysdeps.c, gnushogi/tcontrl.c,
	gnushogi/util.c, version.h: Restore previous copyright information
	that got removed by error.  This reverts part of commit
	82b026e6376b640a4d3409a461dd6bd83708e33e, which changed too much of
	the copyright headers when changing license to GPL3.

2011-09-29  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/eval.c: Fix another hardcored 9x9-board hardcoded value.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/init.c: 
	Document internal APIs.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/cursesdsp.c, gnushogi/eval.c,
	gnushogi/genmove.c, gnushogi/gnushogi.h, gnushogi/init.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.c, gnushogi/util.c: Parametrize more hardcoded
	contants.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/gnushogi.h: Use enums.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/Makefile.in, gnushogi/gnushogi.h, xshogi/Makefile.in: Add
	support for building gnushogi and xshogi out of source tree.

2011-09-27  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* gnushogi/book.c, gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/main.c,
	gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Deal with warnings raised by -Wformat-security.

2009-08-03  Stijn van Drongelen <tinctorius@gmail.com>

	* gnushogi/rawdsp.c: Fixes segfault in gnushogi when asking for
	help.  Closes Debian Bug#434139.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/pattern.c, gnushogi/pattern.h: Statify functions not used
	outside their compilation unit.

2008-02-11  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/commondsp.c, gnushogi/init.c, gnushogi/rawdsp.c,
	xshogi/xshogi.c: Don't intercept INT and QUIT signals, and use USR1
	instead of QUIT for communication.  This braindead use of SIGINT causes problem when a frontend is
	interrupted with Ctrl-C: if gnushogi is waiting for input, it would
	enter a tight loop trying to read stdin, eating 100% CPU.

2008-01-18  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/eval.c, gnushogi/search.c: Fix integer overflow caused by
	bad use of binary operator.  Guess this may make the AI more accurate :) Problem caught by gcc: ../../gnushogi/search.c: In function 'search':
	../../gnushogi/search.c:887: warning: overflow in implicit constant
	conversion A quick audit only revealed a place where another logical AND was
	tested using a curious idiom, so let's make it consistent at the
	same time.

2008-01-18  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/sysdeps.c: Do not attempt to outguess system headers by
	(re)defining errno.  Recent glibc define error as a cpp macro expanding to a function
	call.  Thus, "extern int errno" should cause a link-time undefined
	symbol when errno.h is not included.  Here it is, and gcc complains
	with the following cryptic warning: ../../gnushogi/sysdeps.c: In function 'ElapsedTime_FIONREAD':
	../../gnushogi/sysdeps.c:97: warning: function declaration isn't a
	prototype

2008-01-18  Yann Dirson <ydirson@altern.org>

	* gnushogi/pat2inc.c: Fix a function prototype.

2012-05-20  Yann Dirson <ydirson@free.fr>

	* Add missing info headers
