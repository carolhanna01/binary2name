/* The memory allocation algorithm in this program can be summarized
   with the following illustration:

    contents      next                                           lim
       v            v                                             v
      +-----------------------------------------------------------+
      *
   pointer

   The pointer variable contains the address of the previously allocated
   object.  The first pointer is NULL to identify the object as the last
   element in the list.  This creates a singly linked list which can be
   traversed backwards.

   The memory block starts immediately after the pointer variable at
   the address of contents.  For the current active block of memory
   (the last allocated), two other pointers are maintained:
   - next, the address of the next available character.
   - lim, the end of the current memory block.

   Both the pointer and memory block are allocated in a single call to
   malloc.  This is accomplished by requesting memory past the contents
   variable and manipulating this area with the pointers mentioned above.
