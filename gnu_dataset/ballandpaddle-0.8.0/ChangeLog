2008-09-09  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	direct to level

2008-08-15  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[47] Fixed a bug that stopped the direct to level command line syntax
	from working. game.cpp in draw () checks that paddle isn't NULL before
	using paddle->draw (screen)

2008-08-15  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[46] Re-added doc/ballandpaddle.info. There were merge problems before
	but it means it won't ./configure, make, make install automatically if
	it's not included so hopefully it isn't troublesome again

2008-08-15  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[45] Fixed paddle.cpp and paddle.h so that paddle uses field_width and
	field_height similarly to ball and laser. game.cpp makes a new Paddle

	[40] Added extension functions for each powerup type and started
	testing them

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	to get_powerup_width where it should be

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[35] Added extension functions set-powerup-width and set-powerup-
	height. Made powerup width and height not hardcoded anymore. Added
	calls to those functions in initialize.scm in both savannah and tango

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins  <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[34] Changed non-dark blocktypes to not emit a random powerup in tango

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[33] Fixed issue where laser would hit blocks more than once if more
	than one corner intersected the same block. Made it follow update in
	ball.cpp for how it adds hit blocks to the list

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[32] Added extension function play_sound and removed sections in Ball
	and Laser where it used soundManager->playSound. Added sounds to the
	scripts in the script for the block types

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[31] Added extension function level-add-sound. Added
	get_levelset_filename and get_leveset_name to Game. Removed calls to
	SoundManager::load_sounds. Changed script in tango to add sounds

2008-08-10  Eric P. Hutchins <hutchiep190@potsdam.edu>

	[30] Changed laser to act like ball when it hits a block. Added static
	Laser::current to laser.h and Laser *Laser::current = NULL to
	laser.cpp

2008-08-09  eric <eric@eric-laptop>

	[29] Updated ChangeLog

2008-08-09  eric <eric@eric-laptop>

	[28] Changed the field's x, y, width, and height to be set in the
	initialize.scm script for the levelset and added sextension functions
	set-field-x, set-field-y, set-field-width, and set-field-height.
	Ball's constructor takes field_width and field_height as parameters
	and so does the Laser's constructor. Edited ball.cpp and laser.cpp to
	use the field_width and field_height variables instead of the
	constants

2008-08-09  eric <eric@eric-laptop>

	[27] Modified tango-block.scm so that it sets the brush of the pencil.
	Made dark versions of the tango blocks and made the light ones turn
	into the dark ones when hit and the dark ones go away when hit

2008-08-09  eric <eric@eric-laptop>

	[26] Fixed level1.scm in tango to not reset the ballsize to 12 and got
	rid of the comment in gameover.cpp

2008-08-09  eric <eric@eric-laptop>

	[25] Added initialize.scm for each levelset to the repo and fixed the
	gameover not having the ball_size set when pressing escape to exit

2008-08-09  eric <eric@eric-laptop>

	[24] Changed constant to the ball size in drawing the extra balls in
	game.cpp and creating new balls anytime. Added ball_size to the
	constructor for Ball. New file initialize.scm for every levelset.
