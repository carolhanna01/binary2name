EMI Handler Example
---------------------
This example demonstrates how to use EMI Handlers to process the CLASS_NOT_FOUND exception.

This example uses the HELLO_WORLD class and can be compiled with the following command:

make -f class_not_found.mk

* Briefing
--------------
GNU/EDMA provides a powerful extension mechanism known as EMI (Exception Management Interface). Using this mechanism, GNU/EDMA classes can be installed in the system to manage system exceptions and provide special behaviors in such a case.

The most interesting exception is the CLASS_NOT_FOUND that allows an application to know when a class has not been found and therefore a change to dynamically install it from another source.
