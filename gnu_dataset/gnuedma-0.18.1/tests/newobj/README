Object Creation Example
-------------------------
These examples demonstrate the GNU/EDMA object creation primitives.

The examples use the classes HELLO_WORLD and GRADUATE that should be installed in the system. Compile them with

make -f newobj-1.mk
make -f newobj-version.mk

* Briefing
-------------------
GNU/EDMA provides powerful primitives for object creation including the SIU extension system for binary interface and a version system that allows an application to automatically use the latest version of a component or force the use of a previous one if needed. The examples in this directory shows how to use these features.
