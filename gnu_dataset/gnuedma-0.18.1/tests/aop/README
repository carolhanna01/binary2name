Aspect Oriented Programming Tests
---------------------------------
This examples shows how to use GNU/EDMA for Aspect Oriented programming.

To run examples in this directory

1. Compile them
      make -f all.mk

2. Run examples. Check source code to follow execution traces.

* Briefing

GNU/EDMA provides an extension system named SIU that allows to rewrite basic GNU/EDMA object interaction primitives using common GNU/EDMA classes. This feature provides the basics for setting up a simple Aspect Oriented Programming environment.

The examples in this directory shows how this works. Dynamic and static AOP examples are provided.

- aop_dyn

In this example a simple logger Aspect is defined dinamically at the begin of the program. Then that aspect is attached and detached dynamically to a given object showing the results of object access in each case

- aop_log

Identical to previous example, but in this one, the aspect is attached to object at creation time, not dynamically as in previous example.
