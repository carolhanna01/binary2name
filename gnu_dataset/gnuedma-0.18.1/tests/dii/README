Dynamic Invocation Interface Example
-----------------------------------
This example demonstrates the dynamic invocation interface (DII) provided by GNU/EDMA

This example uses the DII_TEST class that should be installed in the edma_test repository and can be compiled with the following command:

make -f dii_test.mk

* Briefing
--------------
Even when the interface provided by GNU/EDMA is in general interface, an additional "more type-safe" method invocation interface is provided by the system. Using this interface the application can request methods to a given object and after packing the different parameters required by the chosen method, invoke it.
