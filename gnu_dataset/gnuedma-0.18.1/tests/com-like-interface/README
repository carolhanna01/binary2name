COM-Like Interface Example
---------------------------
This example demonstrate how to use GNU/EDMA as a COM-Like component system.

The example uses the HELLO_WORLD object and you can compile it using:

make -f com-like-interface.mk

* Briefing
----------
GNU/EDMA keeps all the information related to classes dynamically and COM-like components can be seen as a simple subset of that broader approach. The function "edma_get_all_met_func" allows to recover the list of object methods as an array of function pointers.

Using the introspection capabilities provided by GNU/EDMA, the data structures needed for the use of these interface can be easily produced at compile-time.
