Preferred Anchor Point Example
------------------------------
This example demonstrates the preferred anchor point feature provided by GNU/EDMA.

The example uses the classes NFILE and its superclase STREAM. Compile it with

make -f pap.ml

* Briefing
--------------------------
The preferred anchor points allow a subclass indicate a name for the anchor point from its superclass towards it. From a very general point of view, this feature allows to rename the "super" name provided by some programming language, substituting it for a user selected one.
