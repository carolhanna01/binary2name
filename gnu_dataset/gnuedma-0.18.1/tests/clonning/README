Object Clonning Examples
------------------------
These examples demonstrate the object cloning primitives provided by GNU/EDMA. 

To run these examples

1. Classes AP_TEST, GAP, HELLO_WORLD, ID should be installed
     See "anchor_points" and "inheritance" to install AP_TEST and GAP
     Make sure that classes HELLO_WORLD and ID distributed with the system are available.

2. Compile the example programs
      make -f clonning.mk
      make -f shallow_clonning.mk

3. Run examples. Check source code to follow execution traces

* Briefing
--------------------------
GNU/EDMA supports object deep and shallow cloning to provide basic prototype-based programming functionalities. The examples in this directory shows how to clone objects and the differences between deep and shallow cloning.

Basically a deep cloning is an exact copy of an object which replicates every component in it (subobjects and dynamic properties). A shallow clone of an object only replicates the provided subobject, linking subobjects and dynamic properties to the existing ones (pointer update but not malloc)
