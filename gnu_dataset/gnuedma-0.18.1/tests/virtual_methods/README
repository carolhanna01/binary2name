GNU/EDMA Virtual Methods Example
--------------------------------
This example demonstrates the dynamic virtual method features provided by GNU/EDMA

The example uses the SUPER_CLASS and SUBCLASS1 classes that should be installed in the GNU/EDMA example repository

Compile the example with

make -f virtual_methods.mk

* Briefing
----------
GNU/EDMA concept of virtual methods is a bit different to the concept in other systems. In GNU/EDMA, virtual methods can be override and restored dynamically and completely changed in any single way you can imaging, including main application functions or methods in independent objects (not in the same hierarchy).

This feature, although very powerful, can be very dangerous if not used carefully as the application type system can be broken.
