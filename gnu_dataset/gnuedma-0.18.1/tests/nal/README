NAL Applications Example
--------------------------------
This example demonstrates how to write NAL (Nil Application Launcher) application using GNU/EDMA.

This example uses the class HELLO_APP version 0.1 that should be installed in the edma_test local repository. Use the following command to run the application:

nal HELLO_APP par1 par2 

* Briefing
----------------------
The NAL application is included within the official GNU/EDMA application. This application allows to write application as GNU/EDMA classes and therefore, extend the GNU/EDMA capabilities at the application level. Features like component versioning or inheritance can be applied at the application level
