GNU/EDMA Inheritance Tests
------------------------------------------
These examples demonstrates the GNU/EDMA inheritance features. They uses extensively the classes in the GNU/EDMA test repository

compile with

make -f diamond_test.mk
make -f inh_test.mk
make -f inner_test1.mk
make -f inner_test.mk
make -f test.mk


* Briefing
-------------------------------------------
Tests description

-test
A simple test showing how to build inheritance hierarchies in the classical way (instantiating a subclass) or in a incremental way (creating a subclass and specialising it at run-time)

-diamond_test
This example illustrates how GNU/EDMA builds, by default,  diamond like inheritance hierarchy, sharing base classes.

- inh_test
General test for GNU/EDMA inheritance primitives. It also demonstrates the use of simple mix-in classes to extend the behavior of general ones.

- inner_testX
Examples on how to use INNER class hierarchies. The first example builds the hierarchy dynamically, and the second example does it statically. In this last example a cast to the top level object is required.
