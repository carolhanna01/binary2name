GNU EDMA 0.18
CORIE Module

In this directory you can find a simple set of GNU EDMA development tools, useful to build GNU EDMA applications, and to manage the system. The tools provided at this moment are these:

* ClassInstaller
This tool allows you to register/unregister GNU EDMA classes from INES specification files. 

Depending on your installation configuration, you must be root to install the class. It depends on the permissions in the GNU EDMA system directory


* cleanup_after_crash.sh
GNU EDMA uses shared memory to maintain common structures whole-system accessible. When an application crashes in a not controlled way, that is, EDMA can't catch the application crash, this shared structure gets corrupted.

Basically the counter on how many applications are using the system isn't correctly updated and the system cleanup which EDMA does when no more applications are using it, never occurs.

This tool allows you to hard free the shared memory block used to maintain the global-system variables. Note that since version 0.18, the sally shared memory allocator daemon is used and this tool is no longer need, however it is keep just in case you do not want to use the sally daemon, for whichever reason.

* EFileGen
This is a simple tool which allows you to build GNU EDMA class and application skeletons to begin building any of this elements.

You can do this using GIDFWizard tool from a .idf file. This is simply a text mode tool for doing the same thing.

KHUMS
This is actually an example more than a tool. KHUMS is a generic server that uses GNU/EDMA components to configure its interfaces and provide its services. You can check the edma_examples repository to find out the interface classes and services provided as examples.
