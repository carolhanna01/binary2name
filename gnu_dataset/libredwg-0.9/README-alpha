NOTE: This is an alpha release of LibreDWG.  It may
have bugs and its interface may change without warning.

With unknown objects and unsupported versions it might crash,
future releases will rather abort on unsupported DWG versions.

The API is usable but still pretty rough, we might still rename
some functions or names for better consistency and add more encoding API.

Please see the file README for more information.
