2019-10-04  lorenz  <looooo@users.noreply.github.com>

	swig: swig4 needs  "stdint.i" to be included (PR #153)

2019-10-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: encode all r2007+ strings as utf-8
	see e.g. GH #109 and #143

	dynapi: add dxf for VISUALSTYLE.unknown_float45
	even if unused in DWG

	indxf: add_LTYPE_dashes

2019-10-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fuzz: protect from dat overflow
	ERROR: bit_read_RC buffer overflow at 18446744073709549374
	bits.c:103:14: runtime error: addition of unsigned offset to 0x7ff41c4a9800 overflowed

	dont advance already overflowed pointer

2019-10-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: fix NULL strcmp
	found via fuzzing, with corrupt input

	decode: fix double-free
	with corrupt compressed sections.
	Found via fuzzing

	fixup htmlescape in src/out_json.h
	this is not library specific, just for helper programs.
	moved to programs/escape.h

2019-10-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	new programs/escape.c,h
	extract from out_json, because we dont want
	to add these to the API

2019-10-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dwg2SVG: htmlescape strings and names
	and for widestrings escape to hex.
	Also protect from a few NULL strings.

	Closes GH #149

2019-10-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	spec: splice TABLECONTENT into TABLE r2010+
	as macro, not to duplicate it.

	spec: merge TABLECONTENT into TABLE r2010+
	a call will not work. TABLECONTENT is only an object, not an entity
	and has totally different offsets.
	Either put it into a macro or duplicate it.

2019-10-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: resolve_postponed_object_refs
	some TABLE/BLOCK/OBJECT field handles neeed to be resolved
	at the end, when the blocks and tables are all read.
	e.g. INSERT.block_header and various layer or other entity names

	Fixes GH #150, INSERT.block_header missing

2019-10-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode: fix VPORT.VIEWMODE
	bit_write_4BITS was broken, and the indxf calculation was missing.
	simplify the 4BITS reader and writer, add proper bit logging.

	indxf: set UCSFOLLOW and VIEWMODE

2019-10-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: better pt logging
	print the proper point types, not just RD or BD

	indxf: fix VPORT.aspect_ratio
	r13+ aspect_ratio is calculated, the internal field
	really is VPORT.viewwidth. added to the API.
	calculate both.

	indxf: more default points values
	e.g. VPORT.view_target.z (GH #150)

2019-09-30  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: fix default points values
	e.g. WIPEOUT.uvec  (GH #150)

	indxf: IMAGE,WIPEOUT.imagedefreactor is code 3
	not 5.

2019-09-30  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	change DIMASSOC, indxf: add_DIMASSOC
	change the spec a bit.
	H 331 seems to be repeated with main_subent_type 73,
	H 332 with intsect_subent_type 74

	The other handles seem to be superfluous.
	Change the order of order of some fields to allow proper dxf
	roundtrips.
	(just rotated_type fails still)

	Only the indices with the bit set in associativity are filled. (no change)

2019-09-30  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: add_PERSSUBENTMANAGER, add_ASSOCDEPENDENCY
	but some of them are not yet encoded.

	encode: implement encode_3dsolid
	for most cases no encryption needed.
	decode has it already, indxf also

	indxf: add postprocess_TEXTlike and MTEXT defaults
	to minimize defaults to dataflags,
	and set default style handle.

2019-09-29  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	json: work on TABLE segv
	when it errored on decode TABLE after num_owned.

	Don't decode a r2010+ TABLE/CONTENT object header twice, only
	process the fields, because it's an entity afterall, not an object.

	But now we need to share the struct fields somehow.

2019-09-29  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: add_TABLESTYLE
	for the subfields.

	We need a seperate Dwg_TABELSTYLE_border from Dwg_BorderStyle
	because of two major differences: BL visible vs B invisible, and
	BL vs BS linewt.

2019-09-29  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	harmonize REPEAT names
	  _ adds idx
	  C does no checks
	  N does constant times (else _obj->times)
	    (and cannot reset times to 0 on error)
	  F does not calloc/free

	spec: VALUEOUTOFBOUNDS TABLEGEOMETRY cell.num_geom_data
	as it happens in example_r13.dwg

	more DEBUG: unstable TABLESTYLE
	promote TABLESTYLE from debugging-only to unstable (just r2010+ is unhandled).

2019-09-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	more DEBUG: check CELLSTYLEMAP overflow
	samples with too small CELLSTYLEMAP survive now roundtrips.
	fix MATERIAL color types

	decode: check for bits string overflows

	encode: better point logging

	indxf: fix new_LWPOLYLINE
	no bulges unless needed.
	properly encode flags from dxf, honor defaults.
	e.g. no const_width if 0.0.

2019-09-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	spec: add TABLESTYLE
	at least until r2010.

	reformat wrong dwg_api.
	also fix a few minor ASSOCACTION decl problems.

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	DOCUMENTOPTIONS is alias for CSACDOCUMENTOPTIONS

	dxf, log: shorter make

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode: fix entity bitsize calculation
	set START_HANDLE_STREAM for entities in COMMON_ENTITY_HANDLE_DATA.

	Fixes GH #142, the very first version which imports most entities.

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: comments, logging only

	dxf-check for 2000/TS1
	use the proper basename

	indxf: encode OLE2FRAME.data 310

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: fix new_MLINESTYLE_lines
	forgot to set MLINESTYLE.num_lines

	also improve some obj->type checks. by int, not by name

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: add dwg_find_dicthandle
	fixes dwg_find_tablehandle for dicts.
	We need to search for the name in the dict given by the first NOD search.
	Not just returning this dict. With MLSTYLE we need to return the
	MLINESTYLE object ref.

	Also use the absolute refs, even if dict handles are code 2, not 4.

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: cosmetics only
	HEADER.CMLSTYLE is still pointing to the wrong
	MLEADERSTYLE object, not MLINESTYLE.

	decode: more stable eed decoder
	with overflow, e.g. when dat does not advance error earlier.
	avoid endless loops on eed decoding errors.

	indxf: more eed size fixes
	the final string \0 does not count. It is just allocated
	for better logging.

	indxf: add DIMSTYLE defaults

2019-09-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: fix LAYOUT subclass conflicts
	groups 70 and 1 are in both subclasses.

	rename two LAYOUT fields:
	  pspace_block_record => block_header,
	  last_viewport => active_viewport.

	fix setting mspace_block_header and active_viewport from dxf.

2019-09-26  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	log BLOCK_HEADER.num_inserts
	for de,encode consistently

	indxf: fix BLOCK_HEADER first|last_entity to abs
	Fixes Reading handle 1F object type AcDbBlockTableRecord
	Error 34 (eWrongObjectType) Object discarded

	indxf: nolinks = 0 for BLOCK
	always add r2000 prev_entity + next_entity BLOCK, even
	if 0

	decode eed: fix data decoding
	dont jump to a wrong end pos

	encode eed: no codepage r2007+
	and add a bunch of LOG_POS dat->byte locations for debugging.

	indxf: collect eed sizes
	only add a new EED size block with a new handle.
	else add size to previous block

	encode: fix encode_eed
	always write the handle after each new sized data block.
	not just the first

	add dwg_find_tablehandle_silent
	and use it in in_dxf.
	not exported for now.

	encode: fix -Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare
	warnings. case size to long to compare same types

	doc: fix ENTITIES summary line

	doc: add Structures for EED and XDATA.
	Maybe more special structs later

	indxf: add postprocess_BLOCK_HEADER
	Closes GH #146

	encode: - logging prefix
	for patched sizes

2019-09-25  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: more abs/rel ownerhandle logic
	dwg_add_handleref: when searching for existing refs,
	DICTIONARY, XRECORD or class may need to be relative.
	skip the search for existing absolute ref then.

	< GROUP needs to be abs, MLINESTYLE e.g. not, is rel.

2019-09-25  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: resolve class types earlier
	via dwg_encode_get_class, from encode.
	improve the abs/rel ownerhandle logic for DICTIONARY and XRECORD

	sample_2000.dxf: add THUMBNAILIMAGE section

2019-09-24  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: ownerhandle abs logic
	abs for all old-style types < 500
	rel for all classes
	WIP dwg_encode_get_class

	indxf: WIP skip eed[0].size for handles
	still wrong though

	indxf: preserve eed[0] handle
	and size.
	handle is unfortunately stored at eed[0], and was
	cleared by the first non-handle value at eed[0].

	indxf: no SEQEND nor ENDBLK prev entities

	indxf: no 2x XRECORD.ownerhandle
	xdata then

	encode: prefer class->number over old type
	When a class with the same type exists, such as
	ACDBPLACEHOLDER or OLE2FRAME, prefer the varies type (>500),
	over the fixed type.
	Fixes Error 34 (eWrongObjectType)

	indxf: better entity defaults
	entities bordering to SEQEND, ENDBLK have nolinks.
	set ltype defaults

	indxf: fixup BLOCK_CONTROL[0].entries[0]
	wrong num_entries

	indxf: flip logging type code

	indxf: fix duplicate handle for BLOCK_HEADER.*Model_Space
	it is allocated at objid 0 for minimal DXFs. Reuse the pre-allocated
	object then.

2019-09-23  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix wrong INSERT.block_header 2 (name)
	Thanks to @soundd1 detecting this bug.
	Closes GH #143

	dxf: fix wrong COLOR.byblock GH #143
	index 256 == bylayer
	index 0 == byblock
	skip bylayer for dxf, and index & 255 turned bylayer into byblock.
	Thanks to @soundd1 detecting this bug

	decode: try to repair the section_info_id WIP
	See GH #144

2019-09-23  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	WIP decode: more r2004 section map checks
	try to fix GH #144.
	allow negative Dwg_Section.size ??

	ignore overlarge Section id > last_section_id.
	added various consistency checks and a section_map_address repair.

2019-09-23  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	json: no 0x%x numeric formats
	they cannot be parsed

	api: change Dwg_Section address to uint64_t
	It is read as such. see GH #144 for a testcase

	dwgwrite: fix -y overwrite
	write the dwg then

	alive.test: timeout 10s
	fails on my mac air with asan and 2 larger dwgs, example_2013
	and example2018 with dxf2dwg

	indxf: set entities entmode
	2 for mspace (default)

	indxf: set entity codes 6, 390, 347

2019-09-22  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: fix init of points
	with extrusion setting pt.z to 1.0, i.e. LINE start.z

	indxf: fix EED for points and handle
	add proper logging

	indxf: but leave room for one active entry

	indxf: fixup entries vs num_entries
	no NULL entries[] allowed. esp. VIEW_CONTROL entries
	are mostly NULL.

	encode LTYPE.strings_area if empty
	All TF, TFF strings must be dumped, even if NULL.
	Fixes Reading handle 14 object type AcDbLinetypeTableRecord
	Error 67 (eDwgObjectImproperlyRead) Object discarded

	encode: no NULL handles, always with code
	Fixes Recover: error eWrongObjectType reading Header.

	spec: fixup LTYPE_CONTROL.bylayer and byblock
	mixed up.

2019-09-22  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: fixup HEADER.CMLSTYLE
	MLINESTYLE, not MLEADERSTYLE.

	Also don't change existing ref.code to 5, recreate if not 5 already

2019-09-22  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: fixup HEADER.HANDSEED->code = 0

	indxf: no NULL ownerhandle, 4.0.0 then
	encode all ownerhandles. do relative offsets only for valid absref
	targets.

	indxf: encode HEADER.FLAGS and CELWEIGHT
	add reverse dxf_revcvt_lweight(), add more HEADER defaults
	which dont appear in most DXFs

2019-09-21  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	silence FIELD_HANDLE names
	add 2 new API funcs: dwg_ref_object_silent,
	dwg_resolve_handle_silent (was static)

2019-09-20  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix xdata 3DPOINT DXF
	fixes XRECORD:
	10 group not followed by 20 group

	dxf: fix DICTIONARY bug
	with dupl. itemhandles

	dxf: skip dupl. 330 ownerhandle
	already via common_entity_handle_data now

2019-09-20  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: log bwd handleref names
	to log fwd handles we would need to scan all object
	types in advance, and then a 2nd time for its fields

	This might catch at least some wrong H refs.

2019-09-20  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: macro aesthetics
	shorten a few vars. add clang-format directives

	example_2000.dxf: add THUMBNAILIMAGE
	to have closer numbers in the generated DWG

	dxf: ATTDEF.prompt 3 is DXF mandatory
	not just SINCE (R_2010)

2019-09-19  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	abstract set_handle_size
	for longer handles

	indxf: reactors[] always absolute,
	but the others, esp. ownrhandle always relative

	XRECORD logging spec
	free aesthetics

2019-09-19  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	GH #85: COMMON_ENTITY_HANDLE_DATA earlier
	Since r2007 we have a seperate hdl stream, which we can call at the
	beginning already.
	This enables the removal of the extra handles loops in the spec.
	But just r2007+, before those handles are still after the normal
	fields. Needs a special free logic there, not to delete ctx.leaders
	before the 2nd loop.

	free: combine common_entity_data with common_entity_handle_data,
	just call them in series.

2019-09-19  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix MULTILEADER leak
	in 2nd REPEAT loop for the handles, when
	the leaders field was already removed by the 1st loop.
	This will be properly fixed later, when we seperate the
	hdl_dat stream earlier from the obj stream, to process both at once.
	The text stream str_dat also. See GH #85, branch work/gh85-common

2019-09-18  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode: set xdicobjhandle to (3.0.0) not NULL
	when empty on r13-r2000

	decode refs not as NULL handle
	To store the original handle.code on encode.

	more logging aesthetics

	dwg_bmp: better BMP offset logging

	decode: fix FIELD_RSx logging

	encode: fixup type with dwg_encode_variable_type
	need the proper class id.
	Fixes ACAD eNoClassId and eWrongObjectType

	decode preR13: strncpy overflow
	tbl->name has only 64 byte

	fix dwgrewrite leaks

	encode: Thumbnail even with empty HEADER.thumbnail_address
	The address may be computed.

	parse the thumbnail data
	mostly for logging

	dwgrewrite: overwrite existing -rewrite.dwg

	log more types
	each read and write should be logged ideally.
	not yet for eed, xdata, sentinels, class.

2019-09-17  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf HEADER strings
	they disappeared in encode FIELD_TV
	with IF_ENCODE_FROM_EARLIER.

	indxf: log HEADER dxf codes also.

2019-09-17  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add proper FORMAT_RLx ditto

	add RSx type

	encode header: set is_maint defaults

	decode: Clearer Handles logging

	encode: fix Handles CRC_LE
	The little-endian variant, not BE.

	indxf: reformat prev.

	indxf: dwg_find_tablehandle is already case-insensitive
	since 7222ec07edb48ab298a3d90f66f5bcb23c1ef245

	indxf: seperate LTYPE bylayer/byblock
	into its own fields in LTYPE_CONTROL. Like with BLOCK_CONTROL
	model/paper_space before

	encode: fix bitsize calculation

	indxf: set tablerecord->xrefref = 1 as default

	encode: fix object CRC
	fix bitsize_pos logging,
	fix object address for the size calculation (dxf only).

2019-09-16  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	log the CRC sizes also

	encode: fix bit_write_CRC logging
	off-by-2

	dxf: add dxf-check
	similar to dxf-roundtrip.sh via TeighaFileConverter, but
	the other way round, for dxf2dwg.

	indxf: seperate {model,paper}_space into its own fields
	set the proper BLOCK_CONTROL fields.

	encode: fixup encode_patch_RLsize
	the size doesn't contain itself.

	indx: set klass->number, fixup ACDBDATATABLE
	in DXF DATATABLE is ACDBDATATABLE, in DWG not.
	fixup dwg->num_classes, to fix writing the last class.

	indxf: fix HEADER points
	and add some more defaults

	dxf: add all the missing codepages
	and its names

2019-09-15  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dwg_find_tablehandle: find in DICTIONARY
	when the ctrl object is a DICTIONARY. Finds HEADER.CMLSTYLE

	indxf: find more HEADER DICTIONARYs
	LAYOUT, PLOTSETTINGS, PLOTSTYLENAME, ... with an ACAD_ prefix
	in the NOD

	indxf: resolve more header handles
	resolve_postponed_header_refs also had a bug.
	search names case-insensitive.
	need DICTIONARY objects for CMLSTYLE.

	indxf: add IF_ENCODE_FROM_EARLIER_OR_DXF
	set dwg->opts 0x20 on indxf, and 0x30 on minimal DXF,
	to set defaults which are not defined in a DXF

	decode: fix FIELD_NUM_INSERTS
	when num_inserts RC > 1, let it count.
	fixes GH #44 to accept one inserts[vcount][0] entity.
	compared to gh44-error.dxf: there's only on num_inserts BLKREF there, so
	it looks correct now.

	encode: better minimal DXF support
	set dat->from_version lower to trigger IF_ENCODE_FROM_EARLIER defaults.
	set empty header.dwg_version, app_dwg_version, codepage, and
	empty HANDSEED.
	skip AuxHeader then.

2019-09-15  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dynapi: BE is a 3DPOINT also
	It could be renamed to 3BE, but that would change the API too much.

	This fixes heap-overflows when importing r12 DXFs, on the first 210 line.

2019-09-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: change handle sizes to long

	support handle sizes > 4, up to 8 byte on 64bit.
	as demonstrated in GH #143 they can be as large as D485E5D6 or even
	FD485E65F.
	Fixes GH #143

	rename SECTION_OBJECTS_R13 => SECTION_HANDLES_R13
	and dont recover offsets for illegal handleoff values yet

2019-09-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode: recover from invalid HANDLES
	either wrong handleoff UMC or offset [MC], which come in pairs.
	default to the next objects then.
	See testcase in GH #143.

	set r2000 section names (for logging).

2019-09-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	bit_read_UMC: default illegal handleoff to 1
	not 0, and the offset from the previous size, to read the next
	object.
	But the root problem remains in bit_read_UMC. See testcase in GH #143

	free: fix double-free of late added refs
	They were added by dxf_block_write - get_last_owned_block.
	This added endblk_entity is not a new ref, it already exists.
	It get's freed by dwg_free.

	free: advoid wrong warnings
	and skip bounds check exits. we want to free all fields

	common.h: fix memBEGIN, unused
	because broken

	move rad2deg to common.h
	define only at one place, not 3

	memmem not used anymore
	was replaced by membits

	build-aux/clang-format-all

	encode: log more fields

2019-09-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	encode/indxf: NULL HANDLE is NULL
	and not a ref to 0.

	harmonize logging of it.

2019-09-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: reverse XRECORD.xdata order

	workaround old darwin makeinfo
	need the texi2any version for @indentedblock

	Merge branch 'indxf' [GH #129]
	Not yet fully finished but ready for master

	dxf2dwg: more stability
	dwg_find_tablehandle can find a NULL hdlname

	Can now write most of the entities.
	set the object_map from the handles,
	fix reading HEADER handles,
	rename dxf_find_tablehandle to dwg_find_tablehandle. It is not just

2019-08-05  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	generate src/objects.inc
	This attempt is much better than a polluted dwg.spec
	Get rid of all the hacks from the previous commit

	WIP indxf refactor
	define IS_INDXF (not DXF nor ENCODER).
	delete all the FIELD, VALUE and HEADER macros,
	as we only parse dwg.spec to get the OBJECT and ENTITY definitions
	but we don't care about the fields and the additional logic.

	more minor BLOCK_RECORD fixups
	search fields with the right name (and log the error).
	fix color.index value

	add VT_INT64 type to dxf/eed
	e.g. BLL REQUIREDVERSIONS [160] since r2013+

	dynapi: fix utf8 conversion
	is_utf8 denotes an UTF-8 input string, not that
	the target may be unicode. is_utf8 is always on in ascii importers.
	dont convert every string pair to unicode, because some fields
	are just TV or TF. we need to wait for that, dynapi_set_helper does that

	add COMMON_TABLE_FIELDS, handle indxf BLOCK_RECORD tables
	ensure the same binary layout for all but the LAYER table.
	fix the wrong BLOCK_CONTROL.entries[] handle vector, and name confusion.
	fixup the seperation of BLOCK_RECORD tables to BLOCK_HEADER and
	BLOCK_CONTROL objects.

	check and fix CONTROL.num_entries,
	check if in reactors or xdict or ownerhandle,
	implement reactors[], xdicobjhandle.

	dynapi: enable color.index, fix DXF
	indxf: read colors (always "CMC"), seperate from points

	api: rename VPORT.ucs_pre_viewport to UCSVP [65]
	which is bit 0 of VIEWMODE [71].

2019-08-05  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: more table fields
	don't translate certain header strings to unicode: 0, 2, 9

	Fixup test-data/2000/TS1.dxf to R2000, it was R2018.
	For now done manually in HEADER only.

2019-08-05  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	indxf: points

	indxf: search also in common fields
	add the common fields for obejcts and entities to the dynapi.
	search also point members (like dxf 20 for a 2DPOINT matching dxf 10  in the field)

	indxf: finish most tables, start with BLOCK_RECORD
	only a few fields are unknown, like 20, 30 for 3DPOINT 10,
	and the common object fields.

	indxf: add_eed
	Only for a very limited number of supported EED codes yet,

	Replace AC_FUNC_STRTOD by AC_CHECK_FUNC
	AC_FUNC_STRTOD broken for cross-compiling

	indxf: postpone header_hdls, accept space in strings
	header_hdls is an array of fields and names, which needs to be
	filled after reading the tables with its handles.
	dxf_read_string failed to read strings with a space, like "Tavolo 3"

	indxf: improve logging

	unrestrict dat before the CRC calculation

	do it absolutely.

	unknown_bits: permit overflow of one byte
	temporary.
	the new restricted streams found this overflow

2019-07-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	seperate and restrict the 3 streams
	to catch overflows, put them on the stack.
	See #85
	This enables now interleaving of handles in the spec,
	need not to be at the very end.

	restrict dat at dwg_decode_add_object(),
	keep the 3 streams at the same initial offset, the
	obj->address - obj->size, and also its size,
	and tighten it later as of now (in decode private).
	Previously the hdl_dat 0 and str_dat 0 were at their resp.
	starts, but this way we can compare them easier.
	Calculating the relative stream positions is now trivial, e.g.
	for the padding check in DWG_ENTITY_END.

	add helper function obj_stream_position() which returns
	the furthest handle position (data, handle, string streams)
	set dat position to the max(dat, hdl_dat, str_dat) for the padding
	and crc check.

	harmonize pos and address name suffices
	pos for bit positions, address for absolute byte addresses (objects only)

	There's no need for the offset fields dat_address,
	hdlpos, strpos, only bitsize_pos is needed for encode, to patch-in
	the bitsize.
	Remove unneeded obj->handle_offset (== obj->bitsize)
	and obj->string_offset.

	Fix clang support for gen-dynapi.pl (#98)
	Add all the -print-search-dirs, not just the first.
	For clang /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/8 is needed also.

	Stabilize clang detection by checking for the include dirs,
	not the executable name (which is cc on FreeBSD e.g.)

	Also remove BITCODE_BS defines clashing with the typedef, leading to
	typedef uint16_t uint16_t; This also fixes many wrong dynapi types

	add and set about 50% of the missing fields

	unknown: re-order in-work area in the spec
	separate UNSTABLE from DEBUGGING

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: refactor 2/2 and regen-unknown
	now got rid of all the slack, and we can regen-unknown even with DEBUG_CLASSES.
	summary went from 142504/2939403=4.85% to 502764/2623166=19.17%

	regen added VISUALSTYLE and many other UNSTABLE classes

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	move VISUALSTYLE back to UNSTABLE
	~480 bits missing

	refactor UNKNOWN_FIELDS/DECODE_UNKNOWN_BITS
	dwg_decode_unknown() helper, used not only for UNKNOWN_OBJ/UNKNOWN_ENT
	but for all unstable classes.
	change to one single bits array with pre bits (if it starts not at bit 0),
	and num_bits (the bitsize in bits).

	free: fix UNKNOWN with empty dxfname
	on free checking an empty dxfname leads to SEGV.
	eg:
	{size = 91, address = 416360, type = 515, index = 240, fixedtype = DWG_TYPE_UNUSED,
	  bitsize_address = 0, has_strings = 0 000, stringstream_size = 0, handlestream_size = 0,
	  supertype = DWG_SUPERTYPE_UNKNOWN, tio = {entity = 0x0, object = 0x0, unknown = 0x0},

	  parent = 0x7fff5fbfe0c0, common_size = 0}
	bypass dwg_free_variable_type for UNKNOWNs.

2018-08-04  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add signed BLs type (420,440), fix DBCOLOR
	add a special int32_t BLs type just write the codes 420,440,
	i.e. the DBCOLOR rgb value.
	rename FIELD_BLh to FIELD_BLx and add more hex types.

	promote DBCOLOR to UNSTABLE. The remaining unknown bits are bogus,
	there's no CMC color field, no duplicate catalog $ name fields.
	Just the BLx rgb field needs to mask off the first byte for DXF,
	and there's a unknown RC. The DXF color index 21 is missing, this
	might be computed.

2018-08-03  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	unknown: more DBCOLOR work

	unknown DBCOLOR: split 430 name and catalog
	in DXF combined, in the DWG split up

	move DYNAMICBLOCKPURGEPREVENTER to UNSTABLE
	the last remaining handles were bogus, they do not exist
	The fiest code 70 BS looks like a class_version, but this really
	would be code 90. Who knows.

	improve UNKNOWN_{ENT,OBJ} logging to -v3
	no -v5 needed anymore.
	regen-unknown with some changed handles.

	fix bit_write_RL/bit_write_BL
	if <0 > 255 makes not much sense.
	handle large negative values, detected by unknown BL node_edge1 -1 values.

	move LIGHT to UNSTABLE
	just a few unknown internal fields are remaining,
	but the known DXF fields are done.

	unknown: regen with new byte sizes
	and without LIGHT (see next commit).
	less overshoots into the next object

	Fix -v5 overshoot errors
	store the size of the common entity/object data, until the
	object specific fields start. for a proper UNKNOWN_*.num_bytes size.
	Note that bitsize does not include the size of the common handles, so we start
	counting at obj->address, but obj->common_size starts counting after the type,
	so we still overshoot by ~18

	unknown: more work on LIGHT WIP

	fix rad2deg computation
	only needed for dxf and unknown

	unknown: skip common_entity_data
	for alldwg_1.inc. no such layer/color fields, which are

	dwggrep: fix the jit, enable --type, --dxf
	PCRE2_PARTIAL_* needs a compiled index [1] or [2] re function, but we
	compiled only a simple (fast) matcher, so the jit always returned
	PCRE2_ERROR_JIT_BADOPTION.
	i.e. the compile options must match the match options.

	also enable the --type and --dxf option.
	for --type we need to set obj->dxfname globally for each object
	to a const string, no threat.

	dwggrep: add native pcre2-16 support
	no need to convert r2007+ strings to UTF-8, match them

2018-06-22  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: ref, object rename, harmonization
	rename several API funcs for proper prefixes.
	Dwg_Object* methods are using the dwg_object_ prefix,
	Dwg_Object_Ref* getters use dwg_ref_get_

	dwg_api:

	dwg_get_type => dwg_object_get_type
	dwg_get_dxfname => dwg_object_get_dxfname

	Add the dwg_object_get_fixedtype API.

	And then rename two uncommon signatures taking Dwg_Object_Ref*.

	dwg_ref_get_object(const Dwg_Data *restrict dwg,
	                   Dwg_Object_Ref *restrict ref)
	=> dwg_ref_object

	which was before named dwg_obj_ref_get_object.

	dwg_ref_get_object_relative(const Dwg_Data *restrict dwg,

	This warning is mostly harmless.

	dwg2dxf: allow multiple input files
	add -o to name the output for a single input file only.
	use dwg2dxf *.dwg is so much easier.
	for the single file filter case we already have dwgread.

	restrict regen-man to POSIX only. didn't work without ./ prefix,
	a help2man limitation.

2018-06-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	in_dxf: extend scanf double
	we still had compiler warnings

	dxf: improve var types RECORD names
	always use the dxfname, not our internal objectname.
	this keeps our names nice, and DXF correct.

	dxf: dxf_cvt_tablerecord with r13 already
	do the allcaps conversion of builtin table names with r13+

2018-06-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	trace: change Unhandled Class object
	to display the object index and handle value, not the position.
	With a handle we can see if it is referenced and compare to the
	subsequent object_map resolver errors

	dxf: remove most minimal
	See [GH #21]. There's not much need for minimal, just
	for writing header and entities. But not for the object fields,
	there are merely version specific.

	dxf: add XDICOBJHANDLE dxf 360

	dwg: move common fields reactors, xdicobjhandle up
	to the common Dwg_Object_Object and Dwg_Object_Entity structs.
	now together with the relevant num_ and binary fields.
	and they don't pollute the entity specific structs.

	dxf: disable XRECORD for now
	and return no error on DUMMY, not DWG_ERR_UNHANDLEDCLASS

	dxf: add reactors to all objects
	even if not used (e.g. not used in each CONTROL table)

	dxf objects: simplify REACTORS
	XDICOBJHANDLE(3) not yet implemented (and unnecessary for now)

	dxf: LWPOLYLINE bulge is also in radian
	I think the DXF group 42 is in degrees. Found no samples yet.

	dxf: convert angles
	add rad2deg to all angles. not yet in_dxf*.c

	dxf: start fixing objects: DICTIONARY*, ...
	fixed DICTIONARY, DICTIONARYWDFLT, PLACEHOLDER, MLINESTYLE (almost).
	set obj->fixedtype when reading.
	ACDBPLACEHOLDER has no SUBCLASS marker in the DXF.
	Some DXF names have a ACDB prefix, maybe rename them back (again).

	dxf: fix REACTORS group -5 => 330
	This fixed reading ENTITIES.
	Now we are struck at the OBJECTS section.

	dxf: move PROXY_OBJECT from variable to switch
	it does not survive the klass 500-num_classes check,
	and leads to an invalid dwg->dwg_class[] access.

	dxf: move 100 AcDbEntity after Reactors

	dxf: BLOCK_RECORD table only r13+
	and check against libdxfrw. oh my, so many mistakes and TODOs.
	we need to get rid of --low again, and fix most minimal checks to
	version checks

	resort the dwg_version_as check
	put the most likely upfront
	as we have a linear search.

	up object_map tracing to -v4 HANDLE

	dwgrewrite: return only critical errors
	as error level result

	fix realloced retval for dirty_refs
	dwg_decode_add_object() does not always realloc anymore.
	only return -1 when it did, otherwise return the uncritical error bits

	ignore CRC mismatch warnings on r2000 for the 1st section
	We really need to know the numbers of setions first, to
	know if its broken or not. These were all false negatives.

	unify CRC mismatch warnings
	print them all in %X hex, not %x or %d

	ignore warnings on invalid handles
	now we get about the same amount of Object not found
	errors as there are unknown/unhandled objects, and someone is
	pointing to it.

2018-06-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: add missing LINE,... pts. POLYLINE special-case
	before r2004 there was no LWPOLYLINE in a DXF,
	only a POLYLINE. need to convert to VERTEX_2D later.

	there was special DXF DECODER/ENCODER logic in the spec
	missing out on the DXF case.

	simplify minimal handling on some objects on the switch,
	not to run into MTEXT again

2018-06-13  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: fix VIEWPORT
	add missing fields 68 on_off and 69 id.
	both hardcoded to 1 for now, as it is not stored in a DWG r13+

	dwg2dxf: skip free (filename_out) also
	not needed, unless you are a valgrind enthusaist.

	dxf: fix major DICTIONARY --minimal bug
	with --minimal it just skipped over to MTEXT, and crashed there.

	document compile-time strcmp as valid
	The strcmp with a compile-time # pasted token and a constant is
	really being optimized away at compile-time https://godbolt.org/g/AqkhwL
	Impressive.

	Fix windows cr cr lf
	Ensure fopen wb mode everywhere for DXF.
	The windows msvcrt fwrite adds a \r before every \n, so we get it twice.

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	skip free with some programs
	time for 40MB DWG went from 3m to 7s, mostly console-out for the errors.
	This is with the new hash object_map. (without it was 2m)

	forget about valgrind reporting leaks. The kernel frees it better.
	The library is still leak-free of course.
	Closes [GH #18]

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	hash: fix the resize logic
	add elems for proper fillrate calculation,
	remove the resize size arg, not needed.
	don't realloc the array at resize, use a fresh zeroed space.
	this fixed getting back random wrong values after resize

	added hash tracing

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	hash: allow 0 values
	use HASH_NOT_FOUND -1 as special not found return value,
	ie MAX_INT32.

	hash: use the new hash for the object_map WIP
	to speed up dwg_resolve_handle.
	looks a bit unstable though.

	hash: check against out of memory

	add int hash with linear probing
	written from scratch in 30 minutes.
	we disallow keys and values with 0, as they don't appear in the object_ref map.
	we also don't need to delete keys, so the implementation can do without
	tombstones (key -1), or a NOT_FOUND hash_get return value of -1.

	decode: fix free obj->eed[idx].raw
	because this could be a raw from a prev. idx.

	common.h: docs only

	dxf: strange AcDbText class separator expected
	move the AcDbEntity specific TEXT field upwards.
	skip non-public LWPOLYLINE flag values.

	dxf: move COMMON_ENTITY_HANDLE_DATA to the front
	dxf expects common data, like layer name, ltype, ... before the
	entity-specific subclass marker.
	it's a common AcDbEntity property after all.

	dxf: likewise rename section to table
	HANDLE_NAME does the name look in a table record,
	not a section

	dxf: rename dxf_write_handle to dxfb_cvt_tablerecord
	it's not a handle, it a table record entry.
	it's not a writer, it just converts/normalizes some builtin names.

	dxf: empty ctrl->paper_space with r2010+

2018-06-11  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	dxf: LTYPE handle 6 => name, not hex
	Now all tables and blocks can be read by acad.

	What other handles are resolved to their name in DXF?
	We eventually need to replace e.g.
	FIELD_HANDLE (DIMTXSTY, 5, 340)
	with
	FIELD_HANDLE_NAME (DIMTXSTY, 5, 340, STYLE)
	to resolve with DXF to the name in the section.

	dxf: always set the global *_control objects

	dxf: progress with tables
	add the missing the layer table subclasses,
	special-case the control handle, and the BLOCK_HEADER name.
	const some objects
	remove all the prev. added RECORD () for the object names.

	dxf: avoid empty numbers
	only strings may be empty. numbers will be changed to 0

	dxf: strip ending .00000000000
	for .0 and .5. It's just a heuristic but catches most cases.
	I don't want to invest much more into this mere beauty issue.

2018-06-10  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	move classes dispatcher into common.inc
	no various copies around. Now the variable typed classes
	are maintained in one and only place. Just the static ones have
	copied switch tables, but this number is fixed. There will be no
	new ones, so I'm fine with that.

	sort classes.inc by stability, entity, and names.

2018-06-09  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	major varying classes refactor
	abstract away the several types of class stabilities in the switch dispatcher:
	stable, untested, debugging and unhandled.
	In the next commit we will extract the class dispatchers into one single
	classes.inc.
	free is now a bit slower because of the dynamic strcmp dispatcher
	checks, but we win in massive consistency improvements. This could also be
	improved later by switching to dynamic enum/int checks.

	fix typo: DICTIONARYWDLFT => DICTIONARYWDFLT,

	add HELIX

	set obj->fixedtype, to the fixed enum DWG_OBJECT_TYPE, which is
	independent on the class index. then you don't need to check the dxfname
	anymore, and we can possibly get away with all the strcmp dxfname.
	This must be enforced by all importers (in_dxf*, ...) also.

	collapse the various SURFACE types to one SURFACE entity,
	in DXF there's only one SURFACE entity.

	Fixed various dead-code issues in VBA_PROJECT, MULTILEADER. Some latest
	changes were hidden behind DEBUG_*. Now not anymore.

	appveyor: deploy as pre-release
	not as draft anymore. They are stable enough to warrant

	errors: pass through decode/encode/print/...
	The errors are now severity sorted bitmasks, and we pass it all through,

	We don't stop on any coding error, we just accumulate the error bits.

	Every dwg_TYPE_##token function returns now an error code.

2018-06-02  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: use -fvisibility=hidden to export only public funcs
	This mimics the default visibility on windows.
	Closes GH #13.

	Some internal unit-tests failed to work,
	they need to link to the object file also, not just the library.

2018-06-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	use $(WARN_CFLAGS)
	do not copy WARN_CFLAGS into AM_CFLAGS, rather
	allow changing it later and using it in CFLAGS.
	Before changing WARN_CFLAGS had no effect at all

	parent: change object uplink to objid
	Dwg_Object_{Object,Entity}:
	  change object to objid field. add dwg field.
	add 2 new API functions to return the Dwg_Object from the obj_obj,
	resp. obj_ent via the objid.

	Closes GH #11

2018-06-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	parent: SET_PARENT macros
	this doesn't yet fix the moving obj problem from #11, but it looks much
	better now. The next commit will fix the remaining link to the moving obj.

	refman: remove flymake temp.

	parent: move parent to the front for generic
	ensure structural integrity, ent_generic just casts the struct.
	also add a couple of testcases,
	remove the obsolete dummy fields from DUMMY, SEQEND and ENDBLK,
	add testcases for the parent API
	fix more parent setters in some structs, check if the child was even created.
	rename some childs to proper names.

	api: rearrange the c file a bit
	separate generic ent section.
	improve the docs for dwg_get_type.

2018-06-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	TABLE, TABLESTYLE, TABLEGEOMETRY, FIELD, LAYER_INDEX substructs.
	I might have missed some.

	See [GH #11]

2018-06-01  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: add parent field to each _dwg_{entity,object}_ENTITY
	See [GH #11].
	We have to jump through absurd hurdles in the API to get around that.
	The parent points to the _dwg_object_{entity, object}, which points
	via the object field to the _dwg_object.

	Also add parent fields to each subentity, such
	as e.g. MLINE_line - > MLINE_vertex -> MLINE,
	and HATCH.

	fix compiler warnings
	avoid unused functions warnings, add them to some if(0) {} dead block.
	add a LAYER_TABLE_FLAGS type specialization:

2018-05-31  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: add generic table getters
	the name of an entry,
	the entries as array of refs,
	and all the common fields of a table control object.

	rearrange internal layout, use COMMON_TABLE_CONTROL_FIELDS
	to guarantee a common control table layout, to access all entries
	from the obj, not the Dwg_Entity_OBJECT.

2018-05-31  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: add more table apis
	so far we only cover block, layer and appid tables.
	add generic dwg_obj_table_get_name, and
	dwg_obj_tablectrl_get_num_entries.

	TODO: dwg_obj_tablectrl_get_entry(index) and dwg_obj_tablectrl_entries - all

2018-05-31  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: remove the entity init functions also
	this is the same as memset(0), affecting only the few geometric fields.
	it's distracting that all the common fields are unaffected.

	what would be useful would be to reset/init the common entity and object
	fields and handles, but there's no API for that yet.

2018-05-31  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: remove the wrong new/delete/free functions
	these were only entity specific, and didn't add them to the DWG
	an object consists of the generic Dwg_Object, a common-entity
	Dwg_Object_Entity and the specific Dwg_Entity_ENTITY.

	Use the dwg_add_ENTITY and dwg_free_object API instead.
	Closes GH #10

2018-05-31  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	api: add dwg_add_##ENTITY to the public API
	change the return value to the newly created object.
	also add the counterpart dwg_free_object() to the public API.

	add const, restrict and API docs.
	dwg_ent_*_delete: remove error arg. free can handle NULL just fine.

	FIXME: Note that these new/delete/free functions are basically useless,
	as they don't add the entity to the DWG. We need to add a Dwg_Object
	and the associated Dwg_Object_Entity and then this Dwg_Entity_CIRCLE.
	See encode.c for dwg_add_##ENTITY for the proper API.

2018-05-30  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	version_codes may not be duplicated.
	duplicate symbol _version_codes in:
	    .libs/dwg.o

	*.inc: add emacs c-mode lines

	add -Wchar-subscripts, which is default on cygwin
	prevent signed char from being used as array index, e.g.

	fix massive obj_string_stream bug
	I once wrote it to take the bitsize as 2nd arg, and then refactored it
	to take the object. (for the has_string flag).
	Not after carefully readng the mingw gcc warnings, I didn't use it in the header,
	but manually pasted the decl into the c files. but just the old decl!
	Tahts why the string stream offset calculation was so unstable.

	This should improve the r2007+ situation a lot.

2018-05-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	write: add internal dwg_add_TYPE api
	For dwgwrite/dxf2dwg we need to create/add arbitrary dwg objects. (e.g. from dxf)
	Add all the add functions to encode.c/.h (later eventually to dwg_api.h)

	rename DWG_TYPE_3DSOLID to DWG_TYPE__3DSOLID for consistency (to create it by type)
	ditto for PROXY rename to PROXY_OBJECT (even if the DXF name is only proxy)
	add fixed DWG_TYPE_object enums for all variable objects, they don't
	match the real obj->type field, which is the class id + 500. But the
	type is needed temp. for the add API.

	Create the objects from an empty/zeroed Bit_Chain stream.  Suppress all
	warnings/errors there.  field values and arrays need to be added later.
	This just allocates the room in dwg->objects and set's up the Dwg_Object and
	Dwg_Object_##type, and esp. applies all the encoding default values from dwg.spec.

2018-05-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	in_dxf: implement helper structures
	global Dxf_Objs holding all objs (header_vars, entities, objects)

	add dxf_add_field for FIELD() and dxf_search_field for the 2nd round

	linear search is enough for those 30 objs, and max 20 fields.
	no binary search or hash needed here.
	these can be used for both ascii and binary dxf. (probably also for in_json)

	on top of the 2004 section format. copy over the logic from 2017.
	harmonizes classes, and fixes reading the last class (max_num) for 2007+.

	This fixed reading most 2007 DWGs

2018-04-29  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2007: better hdlpos calculation
	no -42 offset. start before reading the type after the size.
	then the handle position naturally aligns.
	add a Dwg_Object address field.
	The r2010 bitsize derives from the obj->size.

2018-04-28  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2007: adjust hdlpos by -42

	Most r2007 objects can now be read, just a few remaining errors.

	unify START_HANDLE_STREAM
	esp. it is r2007+ only

	dwg.spec: cosmetics LOG_ERROR
	for invalid DICTIONARY.numitems

	2007: add FIELD_VECTOR_T vcount index

	2007: undo START_HANDLE_STREAM has_strings offset

2018-04-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2007: fix the hdlpos offset
	and ignore the still wrong has_string bit.
	Now the handle_stream and string_stream offsets are correct, just the string stream
	length and bit are wrong.
	Thus ignore the has_string bit for now in START_HANDLE_STREAM

	Fixes many 2007 objects.

2018-04-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	2007: add FIELD_VECTOR_T

	2007: add klass dxfname_u field
	and use dxfname as the ASCII variant for comparisons.
	This fixes reading all the class objects (>500).

	2007: fix obj_string_stream
	The bitsize calculation starts before reading the bitsize.
	Thus initialize the string stream before reading the bitsize.
	The bit is then always 0, as objects start at bit offset 0

	2007: fix EED code 0
	2007 already uses unicode strings in EED

	initialize hdlpos after reading the object bitsize.
	before 2007 hdl_dat is just the same as dat, ditto str_dat.

	PUCSORTHOREF is wrong.
	separate obj_string_stream and section_string_stream:
	SECTION_STRING_STREAM got a prepared str_hdl already,
	START_STRING_STREAM calcs the stream pos from the obj->bitsize.
	encoding >= r2007 not yet started (need to calc. handle and string stream offsets)

	* bits.c,h (bit_set_position): added, set absolute

2018-04-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	add separate handle stream for r2007+
	before R2007 those two streams, dat and hdl_dat are the same.

	but no extra string stream yet.
	we handle that in the dwg.spec extra, locally.

2018-04-14  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	decode 2007 string streams
	for now switch dat back and forth, but we really should provide two
	streams: dat and str_dat for easier dwg.spec integration.
	And we'll also need a third handle stream, hdl_dat. See the next commit.

	decode: demote some LOG_ERROR to LOG_WARN
	they are harmless mostly. libdxfrw just ignores them and much more.
	And LOG_ERROR should really panic, not continue.

	rename examples, dwg prefix
	all this to be able to use bin_PROGRAMS for faster
	debugging cycles, without tests or long cmdlines.
	anyway: rewrite => dwgrewrite, test => dwgread,
	testSVG => dwg2SVG, testsvg2 => dwg2svg2, get_bmp => dwgbmp

	Makefile.am: build examples before the tests
	often we need to test via an example before running the full
	testsuite

2018-03-27  Reini Urban  <rurban@cpan.org>

	fix the dxfname, no final *
	the last char is always \0, don't replace it with *.
	the len BS includes the final \0, but we keep that.
	we only store the ASCIIZ anyway.

	also don't replace unprintable chars with ~.
	we do support encode and codepages conversion later.
	with codepages isprint() is relative.
	thus unprintable chars can only be replaced in temp. print helpers.

	Reed-Solomon (255,239) codec.
	Two routines, rs_encode_block() and rs_decode_block() are provided.

	[w] Writing objects to bitstream correctly - or at least almost.
	* encode.c: fixed dwg_encode_chains() to call dwg_encode_add_objects() at the correct point, plus various fixes.

	It seems that some files are now written correctly to the bitstream. Although, unknown object types and objects with variable type (>500) are still skipped.
	I have also detected various situations in which the Header Variables and Classes sections of the new file are 2 bytes longer than the original file. Comparing both original and re-written files, I suspect that bit_write_CRC() is writing these two extra bogus bytes.

	huge refactoring in SVG generator. Now symbols are stored in <defs> (we are using the BLOCK_HEADER handles)
	But I am still not sure about the correct procedure to select the entities that must be put inside a <g>.
	I tried to get all objects from first_entity until last_entity as they appear in the file, but that does not seem to be
	correct. What is the correct way to iterate over entities?

	R_2004+ provides a vector of handles pointing to everything that must go inside a <g>, but prior versions only tell us the
	1st and last entities.

	fixing the issue described on previous commit.

2009-09-16  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	refactoring our code that handles handles. I have noticed that we are probably having leak issues here. But I still didn't detect exactly what is wrong. Handles are correctly parsed, but their values are corrupted before they are used by client code. Something is messing with our object_ref vector.

2009-09-16  Felipe Corrêa da Silva Sanches  <juca@members.fsf.org>

	correct decoding of BLOCK_CONTROL.
	Now it will be possible to create <defs> section in SVG because BLOCK_CONTROL keeps handles of all BLOCK_HEADERS in the
	file and so we can loop these and read their BLOCKS and output one <g> for each simbol

	This commit totally ROCKS!!!

	hmmm! And we are in svn revision 256!!!! HAPPY HACKING! :-D
