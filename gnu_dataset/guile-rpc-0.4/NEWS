* New in GNU Guile-RPC 0.4

** New features

*** Guile-RPC can now be compiled with Guile's compiler

On Guile 2.0 and later, Scheme source files are compiled to Guile object
files (`.go' files).

*** In non-strict mode, `string' can be used as a procedure parameter type

*** Build machinery has been modernized, now complies with latest Automake

** Bug fixes
*** The upper bound checked by the `uint32' type predicate was off-by-one
*** The compiler would generate invalid calls to 'make-synchronous-rpc-call'


* New in GNU Guile-RPC 0.3

** New features
*** XDR/RPC language compiler, available through the `grpc-compile' command
*** Toy NFS server providing access to Guile's variables, `grpc-nfs-export'
*** Support for recursive XDR data types

** Bug fixes
*** Fix encoding of vectors of floats, doubles
*** Throw an exception if not enough struct fields are passed to `xdr-encode!'

** Documentation
*** Add compiler documentation
*** Add appendix on portability to other Scheme implementations


* New in GNU Guile-RPC 0.2

** Incompatible changes
*** Require Guile-R6RS-Libs >= 0.1
*** `make-xdr-basic-type' now takes an optional `vector-encoder' argument

** New features (see manual for details)
*** Server-side: asynchronous RPC reply
*** Support for one-way/batched RPC calls
*** XDR vectors can be represented as any Guile array type

** Bug fixes
*** `&xdr-type-error' now inherits from `&xdr-error'

** Packaging
*** New `--with-guilemoduledir' configure option
*** Switched from GNU Arch to Git for revision control


* New in GNU Guile-RPC 0.1

** Packaging changes
*** Made part of the GNU Project
*** Switched source code to LGPLv3
*** Switched manual to GNU FDL

** New features (see manual for details)
*** Added portmapper RPC program definitions
*** Added portmapper client `grpc-rpcinfo', similar to `rpcinfo(1)'
*** Added a generic event loop, `run-input-event-loop'

** Bug fixes
*** Better handle disconnections in `serve-one-tcp-request'
*** Various bug fixes in the TCP server loop
