What is new in GNU WebSocket4J 1.3:

- WebSocket4J is now part of the GNU project (http://gnu.org).

- License changed from GNU LGPLv3+ to GNU GPLv2 (or later) with linking
  exception (same license that is used by GNU Classpath project).

- New build system.  GNU WebSocket4J now uses GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake, and
  can be installed by standard './configure && make && make install'.
  Additionally it can be installed in platform specific way for RPM and DEB
  based distributions.

- Documentation includes GNU WebSocket Reference Manual along JavaDoc.

- Sent and received messages are forced to use UTF-8 encoding, so it should work
  properly on platforms that have different default string encoding.

- Fixed bug when client didn't want to accept server's perfectly fine
  Status-line (fixes several compatibility issues with other WebSocket
  implementations).
