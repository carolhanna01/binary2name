This directory contains the 5th release series of the GNU ccScript engine.
GNU ccScript is a and highly specialized embedded scripting engine and 
virtual execution environment for creating script "extensible" applications.  
This system is a C++ class library which allows one to derive application 
specific dialects of the core language as needed through subclassing.

Where ccScript differs from similar packages is both in determinstic
runtime, and it's use of step execution for integrating with realtime
state-transition and callback event driven systems.  That is, rather 
than invoke a function which then parses an interpreter, one executes a 
single "step" statement. This is useful when a callback service thread 
is monitoring multiple devices; each device can have a ccscript 
interpreter instance, and a single thread can dispatch events upon 
demand.

GNU ccScript is used in GNU Bayonne (the telephony application server of
the GNU project) and will likely get used in other GNUCOMM servers.  GNU
ccScript is derived from and requires the GNU uCommon C++ runtime library.
GNU ccScript also supports use of GNU uCommon embedded profiles.

GNU ccScript is also meant to script systems without downtime.  This has
one curious effect; when ccScript is started, a core script is converted
into an "image" object.  When an interpreter instance is connected to
process script requests, it attaches a reference.  If an active script 
is modified and reloaded, a new "image" is created, and new requests are 
then given this new image.  When the last reference against an old 
script image is terminated, the image is also purged.  This allows one 
to compile and rebuild scripts on the fly and load them into memory even 
while active interpreter instances are running.

GNU ccScript is not meant to solve the problems of traditional scripting
engines (tcl, guile, etc).  However, if you need several hundred 
instances of an interpreter running concurrently, if you are building 
state-event systems, or if you need near real-time response through a 
script system, then GNU ccScript may be the answer for you.
