   This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on August
   14 1998 so as to improve compatibility with G P L. This version ensures
   that W3C software licensing terms are no more restrictive than G P L and
   consequently W3C software may be distributed in G P L packages. See the
   [9]older formulation for the policy prior to this date. Please see our
   [10]Copyright FAQ for common questions about using materials from our
   site, including specific terms and conditions for packages like
   libwww, Amaya, and Jigsaw. Other questions about this notice can be
