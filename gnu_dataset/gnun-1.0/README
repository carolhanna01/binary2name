GNUnited Nations					-*-text-*-
================

GNUnited Nations (GNUN) is a collection of scripts to maintain
www.gnu.org translations.

GNUN is free software; see the file COPYING for the precise terms.

For generic installation instructions, see INSTALL.

To use GNUN, you need a working copy of the gnu.org's CVS repository;
it can be checked out with the following command:

   cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/www co www

The files GNUmakefile and config.mk (as well as gnun.mk -- already
maintained in `www') need to reside in the `server/gnun' directory; it
is best to install symlinks:

   ln -s $prefix/share/gnun/config.mk /path/to/www/server/gnun/
   ln -s $prefix/share/gnun/GNUmakefile /path/to/www/server/gnun/

Replace $prefix with the directory where GNUN is installed
(`/usr/local' by default).
