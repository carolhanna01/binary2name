<h4 class="subsection">1.5.1 Accuracy</h4>

<p>When 3DLDF is run, it uses the three-dimensional data contained in the
user code to create a two-dimensional projection. 
Currently, this can be a perspective projection, or a parallel
projection onto one of the major planes.  MetaPost code representing
this projection is then written to the output file. 
3DLDF does no <dfn>scan conversion</dfn>,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
so all of the curves in the projection are
generated by means of the algorithms MetaPost inherited from Metafont. 
These algorithms, however, are designed to find the
&ldquo;most pleasing curve&rdquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
given one or more two-dimensional points and connectors;  they do not
account for the the fact that the two-dimensional points are projections
of three-dimensional ones.  This can lead to unsatisfactory results,
especially where extreme foreshortening occurs.  In particular,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">curl</span></samp>&rsquo;, <code>dir</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tension</span></samp>&rsquo;, and control points should be
used cautiously, or avoided altogether, when specifying connectors.

   <p>3DLDF operates on
the assumption  that, given  an  adequate  number  of  points,
MetaPost will produce an adequate approximation to the desired
curve <em>in perspective</em>, since the greater the number of
points given for a curve, the less &ldquo;choice&rdquo; MetaPost has for
the path  through them.   My  experience with 3DLDF bears this
out.   Generally, the curves look quite good.  Where problems arise,
it usually helps to increase the number of points in a curve.

   <p>A more serious problem is the imprecision resulting from the operation
of rotation.  Rotations use the trigonometric functions, which return
approximate values.  This has the result that points that should have
identical coordinate values, sometimes do not. 
This has consequences for the functions that compare points. 
The more rotations
are applied to points, the greater the divergence between their actual
coordinate values, and the values they should have.  So far, I haven't
found a solution for this problem.  On the other hand, it hasn't
yet affected the usability of 3DLDF.
