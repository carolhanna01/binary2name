<h3 class="section">41.6 3DLDF 1.1.1</h3>

<p>3DLDF 1.1.1 was the first version of 3DLDF since it became a GNU
package (the current version is 1.1.5.1).  It is now conformant
to the GNU Coding Standards, except that
a functioning <samp><span class="file">3DLDF.info</span></samp> cannot be generated from
<samp><span class="file">3DLDF.texi</span></samp>.   The
distribution now includes a <code>configure</code> script,
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.in</span></samp> files, and other files generated by Autoconf and
Automake.  Recompilation is now handled by <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> rather than
the auxilliary program <samp><span class="command">3DLDFcpl</span></samp>.  The files
<samp><span class="file">3DLDFcpl.web</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">3DLDFprc.web</span></samp> have been removed from the
distribution.

   <p>The extension of the C++
 files generated by <samp><span class="command">ctangle</span></samp> is
changed from <samp><span class="file">c</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">cxx</span></samp> before they are compiled. 
After <samp><span class="command">ctangle</span></samp> is run on a CWEB file, <samp><span class="file">&lt;</span><i>filename</i><span class="file">&gt;.c</span></samp>
is compared to the old <samp><span class="file">&lt;</span><i>filename</i><span class="file">&gt;.cxx</span></samp> using <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>. 
Whitespace, comments, and <code>#line</code> preprocessor commands are
ignored.  The <samp><span class="file">&lt;</span><i>filename</i><span class="file">&gt;.c</span></samp> is only renamed to
<samp><span class="file">&lt;</span><i>filename</i><span class="file">&gt;.cxx</span></samp> and compiled if they differ.  This way,
changes to the TeX text only in a CWEB file no longer cause
recompilation and relinking.

   <p>The main Texinfo file is now called <samp><span class="file">3DLDF.texi</span></samp>.  It was formerly
called <samp><span class="file">3DLDFman.texi</span></samp>.  This is because Automake expects this
name.  For this reason, the CWEB
file passed as an argument to cweave has been renamed
<samp><span class="file">3DLDFprg.web</span></samp>.  It was formerly called <samp><span class="file">3DLDF.web</span></samp>.
