<h3 class="section">40.3 Shadows, Reflections, and Rendering</h3>

<p><a name="index-shadows-907"></a><a name="index-reflections-908"></a>Shadows and reflections are closely related to transformations and
projections. 
A shadow is the projection of the outline of an object onto a surface or
surfaces, and reflection in a plane is an affine transformation.

   <p><a name="index-shading-909"></a>3D rendering software generally implements shadows, or more generally,
<dfn>shading</dfn>, reflections, and certain other effects using methods
involving the calculation of individual pixel values. 
Surface hiding is also often implemented at the pixel level. 
3DLDF does no scan converting ((see <a href="Accuracy.html#Accuracy">Accuracy</a>), and hence
no calculation of pixel values at all, so these methods cannot be
used in 3DLDF at present.

   <p>However, it is possible to define functions for generating
shadows and reflections within 3DLDF by other means.

   <p>I have defined the function <code>Point::reflect()</code> for reflecting a
<code>Point</code> in a <code>Plane</code>, and have begun definining versions for
other classes.

   <p>However, in order for reflections to work, I must define functions for
breaking up objects into smaller units.  This is also necessary for
surface hiding to work properly.

   <p>For MetaPost output, I will have to implement shadows, reflections, and
surface hiding in this way.  However, 3DLDF could be made to produce
output in other formats.  There are two possibilities:  implementing
rendering functionality within 3DLDF, or interfacing to
existing rendering software.  If I decide to do the latter, there are
again two possibilities:  having 3DLDF write output in a format that a
renderer can input, or linking to a library supplied by a rendering
package.

   <p>I haven't yet decided which course to pursue.  However, in the long run,
I'd like it to be possible to use 3DLDF for fancier graphics than is
currently possible using MetaPost and PostScript alone.
