<h2 class="chapter">3 Transforming Points</h2>

<p><code>Points</code> don't always have to remain in the same place.  There are
various ways of moving or <em>transforming</em> them:
     <ul>
<li>Shifting.  This is often called &ldquo;translating&rdquo;, but the operation in Metafont
that performs translation is called <code>shift</code>, so I call it &ldquo;shifting&rdquo;.

     <li>Scaling.

     <li>Shearing.

     <li>Rotating about an axis.

   </ul>

   <p><code>class Point</code> has several member functions
for applying these <dfn>affine transformations</dfn><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
to a <code>Point</code>. 
Most of the arguments to these functions are of
type <code>real</code>.  As you may know, there is no such data type in C++
. 
I have defined <code>real</code> using <code>typedef</code> to be either
<code>float</code> or <code>double</code>, depending on the value of a preprocessor
switch for conditional compilation.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a>
3DLDF uses many <code>real</code> values and I wanted to be able to
change the precision used by making one change (in the file
<samp><span class="file">pspglb.web</span></samp>) rather than having to examine all the places in the
program where <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> are used.  Unfortunately,
setting <code>real</code> to <code>double</code> currently doesn't work.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> <dfn>Affine transformations</dfn> are operations
that have the property that parallelity of
lines is maintained.  That is, if two lines (each determined by two
points) are parallel before the transformation, they will also be
parallel after
the transformation.  Affine transformations are discussed in many books
about computer graphics and geometry.  For 3DLDF, I've mostly used
Jones, <cite>Computer Graphics through Key Mathematics</cite>  and Salomon,
<cite>Computer Graphics and Geometric Modeling</cite>.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> I try to avoid the use of
preprocessor macros as much as possible, for the reasons given by
Stroustrup in the <cite>The C++
 Programming Language</cite>,
section
7.8,
pp. 160&ndash;163, and
<cite>Design and Evolution of C++
</cite>, Chapter 18, pp. 423&ndash;426. 
However, conditional compilation is one of
the tasks that only the preprocessor can perform.</p>
