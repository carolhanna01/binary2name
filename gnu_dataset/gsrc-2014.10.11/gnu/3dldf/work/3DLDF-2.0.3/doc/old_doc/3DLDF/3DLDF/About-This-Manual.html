<h3 class="section">1.2 About This Manual</h3>

<p>This manual has been created using
Texinfo, a documentation system which is part of the GNU Project, whose
main sponsor is the Free Software Foundation. 
Texinfo can be used to generate online and printed documentation from
the same input files.

   <p>For more information about Texinfo, see:

   <p>The edition of this manual is
1.1.5.1 and it documents version 1.1.5.1 of 3DLDF. 
The edition number of the manual and the version number of the program
are the same (as of 16 January 2004),
but may diverge at a later date.

   <p>Note that &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;me&rdquo;, etc., in this manual refers to
Laurence D. Finston, so far the sole author of
both 3DLDF and this manual.  &ldquo;Currently&rdquo; and similar formulations
refer to version 1.1.5.1 of 3DLDF as of
16 January 2004.

   <p>This manual is intended for both beginning and advanced users of 3DLDF. 
So, if there's something you don't understand, it's probably best to
skip it and come back to it later. 
Some of the more difficult points, or ones that presuppose familiarity
with features not yet described, are in the footnotes. 
<!-- Others are in -->
<!-- paragraphs marked by a ``dangerous bend'' sign, familiar from -->
<!-- @cite{The @TeX{}book} and  @cite{The Metafont{}book}, which I've -->
<!-- borrowed from Prof.@: Knuth: -->
<!-- @tex -->
<!-- \vrule height 14pt depth 8pt width 0pt\raise5pt\hbox{\dbend} -->
<!-- @end tex -->

   <p>I firmly believe that an adequate program with good documentation is
more useful than a great program with poor or no documentation.  The
ideal case, of course, is a great program with great documentation.  I'm
sorry to say, that this manual is not yet as good as I'd like it to be. 
I apologize for the number of typos and other errors.  I hope they don't
detract too much from its usefulness.  I would have liked to have
proofread and corrected it again before publication, but for reasons
external to 3DLDF, it is necessary for me to publish now.  I plan to set
up an errata list on
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/3dldf">the official 3DLDF website</a>,
and/or
<a href="http://wwwuser.gwdg.de/~lfinsto1">my own website</a>.

   <p>Unless I've left anything out by mistake, this manual documents all of
the data types, constants and variables, namespaces, and functions
defined in 3DLDF.  However, some of the descriptions are terser than I
would like, and I'd like to have more examples and illustrations. There
is also more to be said on a number of topics touched on in this
manual, and some topics I haven't touched on at all.  In general, while
I've tried to give complete information on the &ldquo;what and how&rdquo;, the
&ldquo;why and wherefore&rdquo; has sometimes gotten short shrift. 
I hope to correct these defects in future editions.
