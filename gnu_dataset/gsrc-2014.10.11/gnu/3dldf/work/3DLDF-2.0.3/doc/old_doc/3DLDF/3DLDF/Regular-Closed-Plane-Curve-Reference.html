<h2 class="chapter">30 Regular Closed Plane Curve Reference</h2>

<p><a name="index-Reg_005fCl_005fPlane_005fCurve-692"></a>Class <code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code> is defined in <samp><span class="file">curves.web</span></samp>. 
It is derived from <code>Path</code> using <code>public</code> derivation.

   <p><code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code> is not called
&ldquo;<code>Regular_Closed_Plane_Curve</code>&rdquo; because the longer name
causes too many &ldquo;Overfull boxes&rdquo;<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
in the CWEAVE output of the program code. 
See <a href="CWEB-Documentation.html#CWEB-Documentation">CWEB Documentation</a>.

   <p><code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code> is meant to be used as a base class;  no
objects should be declared of type <code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code>. 
Currently, <code>class Ellipses</code> is derived from
<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code> and <code>class Circle</code> is derived from
<code>Ellipse</code>.

   <p>At present, I have no fixed definition of what constitutes
&ldquo;regularity&rdquo; as far as <code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curves</code> are concerned. 
Ellipses and circles are &ldquo;regular&rdquo; in the sense that they have axes of
symmetry.  There must be an equation for a <code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code>,
such as
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
for a circle. 
A derived class should have a <code>solve()</code> function that uses this
equation.  <code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve::intersection_points()</code> in turn uses
<code>solve()</code> to find the intersection points of a line with the
<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code>.  This way, the derived classes don't need
their own functions for finding their intersections with a line. 
However, such functions can be added, if desired.

   <p>It is assumed that classes derived from <code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code> are
fillable, which implies that they must be closed <code>Paths</code>. 
<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curves</code> inherit their drawing and filling functions
from <code>Path</code>.

   <p>The constructors and setting functions of classes derived from
<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code> must ensure that the resulting geometric
figures are planar, convex, and that the number of <code>Points</code> they contain is
a multiple of 4.  The latter assumption is of importance in
<code>intersection_points()</code>, <code>segment()</code>, <code>half()</code>, and
<code>quarter()</code>.

know what &ldquo;overfull boxes&rdquo; are, don't worry about it.  It has to do with
TeX's line and page breaking algorithms.  If you want to know more,
