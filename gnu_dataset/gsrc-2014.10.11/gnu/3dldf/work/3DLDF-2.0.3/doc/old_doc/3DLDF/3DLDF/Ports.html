<h3 class="section">1.6 Ports</h3>

<p>I originally developed 3DLDF on a DECalpha Personal Workstation with two
processors running under the operating system Tru64 Unix 5.1, using the
DEC C++
 compiler. 
I then ported it to a PC Pentium 4 running under Linux 2.4, using
the GNU C++
 compiler
GCC 2.95.3, and a PC Pentium II XEON under Linux 2.4, using GCC 3.3. 
I am currently only maintaining the last version.  I do not believe that
it's worthwhile to maintain a version for GCC 2.95.  While I would like
3DLDF to run on as many platforms as possible, I would
rather spend my time developing it than porting it. 
This is something where I would be grateful for help from other
programmers.

   <p>Although I am no longer supporting ports to other systems,
I have left some conditionally compiled code for
managing platform dependencies in the CWEB sources of 3DLDF.  This may
make it easier for other people who want to port 3DLDF to other
platforms.

   <p>Currently, the files <samp><span class="file">io.web</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">loader.web</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">main.web</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">points.web</span></samp>,
and  <samp><span class="file">pspglb.web</span></samp> contain conditionally compiled code, depending on
which compiler, or in the case of GCC, which version of the compiler, is
used.  The DEC C++
 compiler defines the preprocessor macro
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__DECCXX</span></samp>&rsquo; and GCC defines &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__GNUC__</span></samp>&rsquo;.  In order to
distinguish between GCC 2.95.3 and GCC 3.3, I've added the macros
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDF_GCC_2_95</span></samp>&rsquo; and  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDF_GCC_3_3</span></samp>&rsquo; in <samp><span class="file">loader.web</span></samp>, which
should be defined or undefined, depending on which compiler you're
using.  In the distribution,  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDF_GCC_3_3</span></samp>&rsquo; is defined and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LDF_GCC_2_95</span></samp>&rsquo; is undefined, so if you want to try using GCC 2.95, you'll
have to change this (it's not guaranteed to work).

   <p>3DLDF 1.1.5.1 now uses Autoconf and Automake, and the
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script generates a <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> file, which is now
included in <samp><span class="file">loader.web</span></samp>.  Some of
the preprocessor macros defined in <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> are used to
conditionally include library header files, but so far, there is no error
handling code for the case that a file can't be included.  I hope to improve the
way 3DLDF works together with Autoconf and Automake in the near future.

   <p>3DLDF 1.1.5 is the first release that contains template functions. 
Template instantiation differs from compiler to compiler, so using
template functions will tend to make 3DLDF less portable. 
See <a href="Template-Functions.html#Template-Functions">Template Functions</a>, for more information. 
I am no longer able to build 3DLDF on the DECalpha Personal Workstation. 
I'm fairly sure that it would be possible to port it, but
I don't plan to do this, since Tru64 Unix 5.1 and the DEC C++

   <p>compiler are non-free software.
