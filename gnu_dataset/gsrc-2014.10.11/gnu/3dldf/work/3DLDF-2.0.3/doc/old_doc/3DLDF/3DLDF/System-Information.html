<h2 class="chapter">15 System Information</h2>

<p>The functions described in this chapter are all declared in the
<code>namespace System</code>.  They are for finding out information
about the system on which 3DLDF is being run.  They are declared and
defined in <samp><span class="file">pspglb.web</span></samp>, except for the template function
<code>get_second_largest()</code>, which is declared and defined in
<samp><span class="file">gsltmplt.web</span></samp>.

   <p>There are two reasons for this.  The first is that template definitions
must be available
in the compilation units where specializations are instantiated. 
I therefore write the template definition of <code>get_second_largest()</code>
to <samp><span class="file">gsltmplt.h</span></samp>, so it can be included by the CWEB files that need
it, currently <samp><span class="file">main.web</span></samp> only.  If I
wrote it to <samp><span class="file">pspglb.h</span></samp>, it would be included by all of the CWEB
files except for <samp><span class="file">loader.web</span></samp>, causing unnecessarily bloated object
code.

   <p>The other reason is because of the way way 3DLDF is built using Automake
and <tt>make</tt>.  I originally tried to define <code>get_second_largest()</code>
in <samp><span class="file">pspglb.web</span></samp> and wrote the definition to <samp><span class="file">gsltmplt.cc</span></samp>,
which is no problem with CWEB.  However, I was unable to express the
dependencies among the CWEB, C++
, and object files in such a way that
3DLDF was built properly.

   <p>Therefore all template functions will be put into files either by
themselves, or in small groups.
