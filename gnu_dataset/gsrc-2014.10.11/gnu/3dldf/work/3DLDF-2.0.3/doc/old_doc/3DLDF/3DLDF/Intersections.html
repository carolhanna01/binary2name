<h2 class="chapter">10 Intersections</h2>

<p><a name="index-intersection-81"></a><a name="index-intersection-points-82"></a><a name="index-Path-intersections-83"></a><a name="index-output-file-84"></a><a name="index-arbitrary-Path-85"></a>There are no functions for finding the intersection points of two (or
more) arbitrary <code>Paths</code>.  This is impossible, so long as 3DLDF
outputs MetaPost code. 
3DLDF only &ldquo;knows&rdquo; about the <code>Points</code> on a
<code>Path</code>;  it doesn't actually generate the curve or other figure
that passes through the <code>Points</code>, and consequently doesn't &ldquo;know&rdquo;
how it does this.

   <p><a name="index-arbitrary-Path-86"></a><a name="index-intersection-87"></a><a name="index-intersection-points-88"></a><a name="index-Path-intersections-89"></a><a name="index-connectors-90"></a><a name="index-Path-connectors-91"></a>In addition, an arbitrary <code>Path</code> can contain connectors. 
In 3DLDF, the connectors are
merely <code>strings</code> and are written verbatim to the output file,
however, in MetaPost they influence the form of a <code>Path</code>.

   <p><a name="index-non_002darbitrary-Path-92"></a><a name="index-intersection-93"></a><a name="index-intersection-points-94"></a><a name="index-Path-intersections-95"></a>3DLDF can, however, find the intersection points of some
<em>non-arbitrary</em> <code>Paths</code>.  So far, it can find the intersection
point of the following combinations of <code>Paths</code>:

   <p><a name="index-Point_003a_003aintersection_005fpoints-96"></a>
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Two linear <code>Paths</code>, i.e., <code>Paths</code>
for which <code>Path::is_linear()</code> returns <code>true</code>
(see <a href="Querying-Paths.html#Querying-Paths">Path Reference; Querying</a>). 
In addition, the <code>static Point</code> member function
<code>Point::intersection_points()</code> can be called with four <code>Point</code>
arguments.  The first and second arguments are treated as the end points
of one line, and the third and fourth arguments as the end points of the
other.

     <li>A line and a <code>Polygon</code>.  Currently, <code>Reg_Polygon</code> and
<code>Rectangle</code> are the only classes derived from <code>Polygon</code>.

     <li>Two <code>Polygons</code>.

     <li>A line and a Regular Closed Plane Curve (<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code>,
see <a href="Regular-Closed-Plane-Curve-Intersections.html#Regular-Closed-Plane-Curve-Intersections">Regular Closed Plane Curve Reference; Intersections</a>).  Currently,
<code>Ellipse</code> and <code>Circle</code> are the only classes derived from
<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve</code>.

     <li>Two <code>Ellipses</code>.  Since a <code>Circle</code> is also an <code>Ellipse</code>,
one or both of the <code>Ellipses</code> may be a <code>Circle</code>. 
See <a href="Ellipse-Intersections.html#Ellipse-Intersections">Ellipse Reference; Intersections</a>.
        </ol>

   <p>Adding more functions for finding the intersections of various geometric
figures is one of my main priorities with respect to extending 3DLDF.

   <p>There are currently no special
functions for finding the intersection points
of a line and a <code>Circle</code> or two <code>Circles</code>.  Since the
<code>class Circle</code> is derived from <code>class Ellipse</code>,
<code>Circle::intersection_points()</code> resolves to
<code>Ellipse::intersection_points()</code>, which, in turn, calls
<code>Reg_Cl_Plane_Curve::intersection_points()</code>. 
This does the trick, but it's much easier to find the intersections for
<code>Circles</code> that it is for <code>Ellipses</code>.  In particular, the
intersections of two coplanar <code>Circles</code> can be found
algebraically, whereas I've had to implement a numerical solution for
the case of two coplanar <code>Ellipses</code> with different centers and/or
axis orientation.  It may also be worthwhile to write
a specialization for
finding the intersection points of a <code>Circle</code> and an
<code>Ellipse</code>.

mathematics.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>
As I learn more about it, I plan to define more
<code>classes</code> to represent various curves (two-dimensional ones to
start with) and functions for finding their intersection points.

<h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The books on computer graphics and the fairly elementary
mathematics books that I own or have referred to don't go into
intersections very deeply.  One that does is
Fischer, Gerd.  <cite>Ebene Algebraische Kurven</cite>, which is a bit over my
head.</p>
