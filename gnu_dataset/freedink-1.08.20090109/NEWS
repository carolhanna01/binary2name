1.08.20090109
=============

* User-visible changes:

- i18n ("internationalization") - or support for translating D-Mods.

- Fix some crashes due to improper D-Mod scripts (e.g. attempt to
  modify sprite #1000): DinkC scripts are now better validated to
  avoid this.

* Developer notes:

- DinkC functions are now called dynamically using libffi, for cleaner
  bindings to the C engine core.  The DinkC parser code was also
  clarified and a few string functions were optimized.


1.08.20080920
=============

* User-visible changes:

- Supports playing Ogg Vorbis for background music (will look for .ogg
  extension before .mid extension)

* Developer notes:

- Supports /usr/share/games alternate prefix for game data.

- Can search and use system fonts under FreeDesktop-compliant systems
  (using fontconfig)


1.08.20080828: first official release
=====================================

FreeDink is based on version 1.07 of the original engine and also
incorporates v1.08 improvements.

The main change is that FreeDink is portable, so it can work under
operating systems (e.g. GNU/Linux) and architectures (e.g. PowerPC).

The following describe some differences with the original game engine.

* User-visible changes:

- Backward-incompatible changes in v1.08 can be disabled using a
  'v1.07 mode' (--v1.07 option -- more information in doc/v1.08.txt).
  This allows playing D-Mods that weren't upgraded to v1.08 yet.

- Game graphics

  - Better windowed mode: supports non-truecolor mode, and can switch
    between windowed and full-screen using Alt + Enter (X11 only).

  - Avoid color/palette temporary glitch after quitting show_bmp()
    mode.

  - Smoother truecolor fades, and avoid some glitches in palette mode.

  - Use a different but metric-compatible fonts (alignment and
    wrapping are conserved), due to copyright issues (see
    doc/fonts.txt).

  - Widen debug-mode line to avoid some unwanted line wrapping.

- Gamepad: the threshold for joystick axis is slightly greater - with
  the same threshold than the original game (~10%) Dink is going diags
  too easily.  Feedback welcome :)

- Game speed: set maximum framerate to 50 FPS, which is compatible
  with v1.08 (see doc/framerate.txt)

- Installation: supports separate directories for original data and
  additional D-Mods.  This permits installing the game as
  administrator in a write-protected directory, while allowing normal
  users to install D-Mods in their personal directory.

- Memory usage

  - Requires less memory in truecolor mode (by not converting paletted
    graphics to truecolor)

  - Fixes memory leaks, in particular when loading a savegame
    (reloaded graphics were duplicated in memory)

- Editor fixes:

  - To avoid issues with non-US keyboards in the editor, F1->F10-F11
    and NumPad 0->9-. are used in addition to 1->0-` for tiles
    selection.

  - When vision is changed from the minimap mode in the editor, don't
    display the current screen's sprites over the minimap.

  - When text or number is asked in the editor, user now can press
    'escape' to discard changes.

  - In editor "Alternative Tile Hardness Selector", when going
    completely to the right or to the bottom of the screen, avoid a
    postponement for the square selector. Reported at
    http://www.dinknetwork.com/forum.cgi?MID=57829

  - When editing hardness, print the hardness index actually being
    edited, instead of the one associated by the current background
    tile.

  - Display real-time information about hardness in hardness mode.

* Developer notes:

- Compressed BMP support: afaics in some situations, the original Dink
  engines does not support compressed (RLE?) BMPs. Such BMPs are
  notably used in "Prophecy of the Ancients" (like the 3 alternate
  colored orbs) - when support is lacking, graphics are simply not
  displayed which much complaining in DEBUG.TXT. I believe this
  support depends on which DX version is used. More surprisingly:
  there's a screen, still in PotA, where you can pass above and under
  and bridge (you need to pass under the bridge to blow up a rock in
  the above screen and thus reach the secret island). There's no way
  to pass under the bridge when there's no compressed BMP support - I
  haven't investigated much, but I guess either a missing sprite does
  not clear the hardness for Dink to pass, either the missing sprite
  is causing a DinkC script to stop.  So, vanilla SDL does not support
  compressed BMPs, so I used SDL_image everywhere to do so. This means
  that FreeDink always support compressed BMPs.

- Fix several array-out-of-bounds issues while reproducing the
  original de-facto engine behavior.

  - For example, in 'init_scripts', the script may check the active
    status of sprite 1000, while the sprite array has 300
    elements. This caused bugs after the port and is now
    fixed. Curiously it didn't seem to cause bugs before. Such bug did
    'appear' in v1.08 too.

  - Sometimes, a init() or dink.ini line would be more than 80 chars,
    which is its allocated length in the 'sequence' structure. This
    would overwrite parts of the next sequence. Possibly this never
    was an issue, because sequences were initialized incrementally,
    but an init() line was more likely to cause breakage. This is
    fixed anyway.

  - When reloading a sequence through init() with a longer sequence,
    v1.07 will overwrite bits of the next sequence, for dir.ff loading
    only. v1.08 overwrites for both BMPs and dir.ff sequences to avoid
    to a bug with mixed dir.ff and BMPs sequences. This bug is
    documented in dink.ini and loads the sword (longer) hit sequence
    before the first (shorter) sequence to work-around it. See
    http://www.dinknetwork.com/forum.cgi?MID=92733 for details. In
    FreeDink, sequences are never overwritten.

  - Some D-Mods have sequences with more than 50 frames. This triggers
    a buffer overflow in the original game BUT the overwritten data is
    the animation metadata ('delay' and 'special' fields), which is
    not critical for non-animated sprite sequences. Example: "The
    Green Voice in my Head - Part 1 - Hangover & Agony", first save
    game then east then house on the right: it shows a shelf with
    broken vases with is seq 66 frame 65 (> 50). FreeDink reproduces
    this behavior by allowing up to 1000 frames in a sequence but
    without the buffer overflow part.

- Command line: fails on invalid options.  Supports undocumented
  '-nomovie' for compatibility with DFArc2.  Supports short aliases
  (e.g. -window -> -w) and double-dash options (e.g. -window ->
  --window).

- Search path: Dink search data in additional places to support
  separating reference data and user D-Mods. Check
  doc/directory_layout.txt for information.

- Dinkedit

  - Dinkedit creates a custom sequence #1 but mark the 4th frame as
    '-1'.  This made FreeDinkEdit crash, so it's set to 0, which means
    "end of sequence".

  - The editor palette is now Ts01.bmp instead of esplash.bmp - just
    like the game. This is simpler that way, and nobody changed the
    editor palette anyway.
