Bugs that existed in v1.07 and needs to be fixed:

- [UNCONFIRMED] repeating sounds are kept alive when you "restart from
  scratch"

- Do not take [space] into account for killing a text if the text just
  appeared on the screen

- When saying a text near the border of a screen, it isn't placed
  correctly the very first time it's displayed

- say_stop*(&sprite, ...) kills other text sprites related to
  &sprite. Unfortunately this prevents those other texts to return to
  their originating script, because of kill_text_owned_by(). This is
  discussed in http://www.dinknetwork.com/forum.cgi?MID=92406 so it's
  also present in v1.08.

- "Dinkedit has, and forever will, crash if you type in really big
  numbers. You should know better."

- "Dinkedit may crash if opening certain D-Mods with a dink.ini from
  WDE 1.1-1.4. Try using an older version of Dinkedit, such as that
  included with the v1.07 patch, or use WinDinkedit."
