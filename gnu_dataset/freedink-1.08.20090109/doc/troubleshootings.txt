  You probably use a version of SDL that does not support DX. The
  non-DX implementation appears to be less performant.

  You need to compile SDL with DX support (check woe-compile.txt) or
  use official binaries.

  There is a problem with some versions of the FreeType library, which
  is use to render fonts. Unfortunately Debian Etch and Fedora Core 6
  (among others) currently ship with that version, so you'll have to
  recompile it, or use a backport, or use a later release of the
  distribution. FreeType version 2.3.5 (shipped with Fedora 7) works
  fine.

  We'll probably provide big, statically compiled FreeDink binaries in
  the future to bypass this kind of issues.
