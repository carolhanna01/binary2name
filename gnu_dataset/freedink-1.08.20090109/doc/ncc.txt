NCC (http://students.ceid.upatras.gr/~sxanth/ncc/) helps browsing the
code by presenting global variables and functions according to where
they are used and what they use in turn. It can be useful to get
acquainted with the code. It is invoked as a wrapper for gcc.

$ CC="ncc -ncgcc -ncld -ncfabs" AR=nccar LD=nccld ./configure
$ make
$ nccnav src/freedink.nccout

v2.7 includes a patch by me ;)
