GNUsound:
=========

- Understaffed!
- Unwarranted!
- Unix incompatible!

System requirements:
====================

- Linux >= 2.4
- GNOME >= 1.4 or >= 2.4
- libglade >= 0.14
- libaudiofile >= 0.2.3

Recommendations:
================

libsamplerate              http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
libsndfile                 http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
FFmpeg                     http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/
libmp3lame                 http://mp3dev.org/
FLAC                       http://flac.sourceforge.net/
GLADSPA                    http://www.ladspa.org/

[ LADSPA stands for "Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin
  Architecture". This name is inaccurate, since neither is the
  functionality of LADSPA exclusively tied to the Linux kernel, nor
  are the developers of LADSPA related to Linux kernel
  development. The name LADSPA therefore furthers the confusion
  between the Linux kernel and the GNU/Linux system. As part of the
  GNU Project's effort to clear up this confusion, we refer to
  LADSPA as GLADSPA instead. For more information on why the name
  Linux does not fairly describe the GNU/Linux system, see
  http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html ]
