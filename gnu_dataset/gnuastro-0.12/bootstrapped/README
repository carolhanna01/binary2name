Imported files to GNU Astronomy Utilities
=========================================

See the end of the file for license conditions.

The contents of this directory (except this README file!) are imported
to GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) from other projects. Therefore
they are not maintained by Gnuastro developers and are kept separately
in this directory for clarity and easy maintenance.

In the version controlled repository this directory only contains this
single README file. It is populated during the bootstrapping process
(see ../README-hacking for more on bootstrapping, or the
"Bootstrapping" section in the manual). In the distribution tar-ball
this directory is populated with the necessary files.

The projects that were used are:

 - GNU Portability Library (Gnulib):

       https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

   This is a very useful collection of libraries (from GNU C library)
   to enable non-complying operating systems to run programs based on
   it. It also contains various very useful scripts needed for the GNU
   build process.



 - GNU Autoconf-archives:

       https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/

   These archives contain a large number of M4 scripts that can be
   used at ./configure time.



We are most grateful to the maintainers of these projects which allow
Gnuastro to be easily installed on a very large set of Unix-like
operating systems.
