.SH NAME
astscript-sort-by-night \- Sort input FITS files by night
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B astscript-sort-by-night
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR] \fI\,FITS-files\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script is part of GNU Astronomy Utilities 0.12.
.PP
This script will look into a HDU/extension for a header keyword in the
given FITS files and interpret the value as a date. The inputs will be
separated by "night"s. The definition a "nights" is set with the '\-\-hour'
option (just note that the FITS time may be recorded in UTC, not local
time)! It will then print a list of all the input files along with the
following two columns: night number and file number in that night (sorted
by time). With '\-\-link' a symbolic link (one for each input) will be made
with names including the night classifier. With '\-\-copy' instead of a link,
a copy of the inputs will be made.
.PP
For more information, please run any of the following commands. In
particular the first contains a very comprehensive explanation of this
script's invocation: expected input(s), output(s), and a full description
of all the options.
