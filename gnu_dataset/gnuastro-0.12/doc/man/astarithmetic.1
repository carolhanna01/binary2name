.SH NAME
Arithmetic \- arithmetic operations on images and numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B astarithmetic
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR...] \fI\,ASTRdata or number \/\fR[\fI\,ASTRdata\/\fR] \fI\,OPERATOR \/\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Arithmetic is part of GNU Astronomy Utilities 0.12.
Arithmetic will do arithmetic operations on one or multiple images and numbers.
Simply put, the name of the image along with the arithmetic operators and
possible numbers are given as arguments. The extensions of each input are
specified with (possibly multiple) calls to the '\-\-hdu' option.
.PP
Currently Arithmetic only supports postfix or reverse polish notation. For
example to get the result of '5+6', you should write '5 6 +', or to get the
average of two images, you should write 'a.fits b.fits + 2 /' (or more simply
use the 'average' operator with 'a.fits b.fits average'). Please see the manual
for more information.
.PP
Arithmetic recognizes a large collection of standard operators, including basic
arithmetic (e.g., +, \-, x, /), mathematical (e.g., abs, pow, sqrt, log),
statistical (minvalue, min, max, average), comparison (e.g., lt, le, gt),
logical (e.g., and, or, not), the full set of bitwise operators, and numeric
type conversion operators to all known types. Please run the command below for
a complete list describing all operators (press the 'SPACE' keyboard key, or
arrow keys, to go down and 'q' to return to the command\-line):
