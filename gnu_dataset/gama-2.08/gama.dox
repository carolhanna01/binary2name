/** \mainpage GNU Gama classes and functions

GNU Gama http://www.gnu.org/software/gama is a project dedicated to
adjustment of geodetic networks. It is intended for use with
traditional geodetic surveyings which are still used and needed in
special measurements (e.g., underground or high precision engineering
measurements) where the Global Positioning System (GPS) cannot be
used.

Adjustment in local Cartesian coordinate systems is fully supported by
a command-line program gama-local that adjusts geodetic (free)
networks of observed distances, directions, angles, height
differences, 3D vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with
given variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in global coordinate
systems is supported only partly as a gama-g3 program.


GNU Gama can be found in the subdirectory /gnu/gama/ on any of GNU FTP
server mirrors http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gama or checked-out from the
GIT server. See our project page at
http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gama/ for more information.

To get an anonymous read-only access to the GIT repository for the
latest GNU Gama source, issue the following command

\verbatim
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gama.git
\endverbatim

The collection of sample networks is available separately. To checkout
the gama-local examples from GIT use the command

\verbatim
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/gama/examples.git
\endverbatim
