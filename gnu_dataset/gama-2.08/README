GNU package Gama is a C++ free software for geodesy released under GNU
General Public Licence. Project Gama was started in 1998, in 2001 was
dubbed a GNU packaqe.

    [Version Number] of the package is defined in configure.ac

    [General Description] GNU Gama is a project dedicated to
    adjustment of geodetic networks. It is intended for use with
    traditional geodetic surveyings which are still used and needed in
    special measurements (e.g., underground or high precision
    engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning System
    (GPS) cannot be used.

    Adjustment in local Cartesian coordinate systems is fully
    supported by a command-line program gama-local that adjusts
    geodetic (free) networks of observed distances, directions,
    angles, height differences, 3D vectors and observed coordinates
    (coordinates with given variance-covariance matrix). Adjustment in
    global coordinate systems is supported only partly as a gama-g3
    program.

    [Compiler] To build Gama, the compiler must support c++11
        standard. Purposefully there are no constructs based on c++14
        to enable builds with a wider range of available compilers. To
        check the compiler support of c++11 features, configure.ac
        calls macro AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11, you need either to
        install package autoconf-archive or download it from
        git://git.sv.gnu.org/autoconf-archive.git. See
        https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/
        ax_cxx_compile_stdcxx_11.html

    [The file INSTALL] is available from the top distribution
         directory, it contains an explanation of the installation
         procedure.
