This program is used by AutoGen to help clean up and organize

See @file{autogen/agen5/fsm.tpl} and the generated output
@file{pseudo-fsm.h}.

This function was not implemented as an expression function because
either it would have to be many expression functions, or a provision
would have to be added to provide options to expression functions.
Maybe not a bad idea, but it is not being implemented at the moment.

A side benefit is that you can use it outside of AutoGen to columnize
input, a la the @code{ls} command.';
