/*=gfunc makefile_script
 *
 * what:  create makefile script
 * general_use:
 *
 * exparg: text, the text of the script
 *
 * doc:
 *  This function will take ordinary shell script text and reformat it
 *  so that it will work properly inside of a makefile shell script.
 *  Not every shell construct can be supported; the intent is to have
 *  most ordinary scripts work without much, if any, alteration.
 *
 *  The following transformations are performed on the source text:
 *
 *  @enumerate
 *  @item
 *  Trailing whitespace on each line is stripped.
 *
 *  @item
 *  Except for the last line, the string, " ; \\" is appended to the end of
 *  every line that does not end with a backslash, semi-colon,
 *  conjunction operator or pipe.  Note that this will mutilate multi-line
 *  quoted strings, but @command{make} renders it impossible to use multi-line
 *  constructs anyway.
 *
 *  @item
 *  If the line ends with a backslash, it is left alone.
 *
 *  @item
 *  If the line ends with one of the excepted operators, then a space and
 *  backslash is added.
 *
 *  @item
 *  The dollar sign character is doubled, unless it immediately precedes an
 *  opening parenthesis or the single character make macros '*', '<', '@@',
 *  '?' or '%'.  Other single character make macros that do not have enclosing
 *  parentheses will fail.  For shell usage of the "$@@", "$?" and "$*"
 *  macros, you must enclose them with curly braces, e.g., "$@{?@}".
 *  The ksh construct @code{$(<command>)} will not work.  Though some
 *  @command{make}s accept @code{$@{var@}} constructs, this function will
 *  assume it is for shell interpretation and double the dollar character.
 *  You must use @code{$(var)} for all @command{make} substitutions.
 *
 *  @item
 *  Double dollar signs are replaced by four before the next character
 *  is examined.
 *
 *  @item
 *  Every line is prefixed with a tab, unless the first line
 *  already starts with a tab.
 *
 *  @item
 *  The newline character on the last line, if present, is suppressed.
 *
 *  @item
 *  Blank lines are stripped.
 *  @end enumerate
 *
 *  @noindent
 *  This function is intended to be used approximately as follows:
 *
 *  @example
 *  $(TARGET) : $(DEPENDENCIES)
 *  <+ (out-push-new) +>
 *  ....mostly arbitrary shell script text....
 *  <+ (makefile-script (out-pop #t)) +>
 *  @end example
