@deftypefun {int} {gss_oid_equal} (gss_const_OID @var{first_oid}, gss_const_OID @var{second_oid})
@var{first_oid}: (Object ID, read) First Object identifier.

@var{second_oid}: (Object ID, read) First Object identifier.


Compare two OIDs for equality.  The comparison is "deep", i.e., the
actual byte sequences of the OIDs are compared instead of just the
pointer equality.  This function is standardized in RFC 6339.

Return value:
Returns boolean value true when the two OIDs are
  equal, otherwise false.
