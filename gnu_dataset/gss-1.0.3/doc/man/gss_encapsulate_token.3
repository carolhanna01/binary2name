.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gss_const_buffer_t input_token" 12
(buffer, opaque, read) Buffer with GSS\-API context token data.
.IP "gss_const_OID token_oid" 12
(Object ID, read) Object identifier of token.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Add the mechanism\-independent token header to GSS\-API context token
data.  This is used for the initial token of a GSS\-API context
establishment sequence.  It incorporates an identifier of the
mechanism type to be used on that context, and enables tokens to be
interpreted unambiguously at GSS\-API peers.  See further section
3.1 of RFC 2743.  This function is standardized in RFC 6339.
.SH "RETURNS"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Indicates successful completion, and that output
parameters holds correct information.

`GSS_S_FAILURE`: Indicates that encapsulation failed for reasons
unspecified at the GSS\-API level.
