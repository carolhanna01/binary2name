.SH NAME
gss_decapsulate_token \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gss.h>
.sp
.BI "OM_uint32 gss_decapsulate_token(gss_const_buffer_t " input_token ", gss_const_OID " token_oid ", gss_buffer_t " output_token ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gss_const_buffer_t input_token" 12
(buffer, opaque, read) Buffer with GSS\-API context token.
.IP "gss_const_OID token_oid" 12
(Object ID, read) Expected object identifier of token.
.IP "gss_buffer_t output_token" 12
(buffer, opaque, modify) Decapsulated token data;
  caller must release with \fBgss_release_buffer()\fP.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Remove the mechanism\-independent token header from an initial
GSS\-API context token.  Unwrap a buffer in the
mechanism\-independent token format.  This is the reverse of
\fBgss_encapsulate_token()\fP.  The translation is loss\-less, all data is
preserved as is.  This function is standardized in RFC 6339.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"

`GSS_S_COMPLETE`: Indicates successful completion, and that output
parameters holds correct information.

`GSS_S_DEFECTIVE_TOKEN`: Means that the token failed consistency
checks (e.g., OID mismatch or ASN.1 DER length errors).

`GSS_S_FAILURE`: Indicates that decapsulation failed for reasons
unspecified at the GSS\-API level.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
