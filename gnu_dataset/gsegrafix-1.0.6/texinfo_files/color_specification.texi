@unnumbered 6 Color specification
Colors can be described with three characteristics: hue (hue varies from 0 to 360 degrees on a color wheel), value or brightness (brightness varies from 0 to 255), and saturation or hue dominance (saturation varies from 0 to 255). The colors black, gray, silver, and white correspond to minimum color saturation of 0 and color brightness of 0 (black), 128 (gray), 192 (silver), and 255 (white). The colors red, yellow, lime, aqua, blue, and fuchsia correspond to maximum color saturation of 255 and maximum color brightness of 255. These colors represent hues of 0 (red), 60 (yellow), 120 (lime), 180 (aqua), 240 (blue), and 300 (fuchsia). The colors maroon, olive, green, teal, navy, and purple correspond to the same hues and maximum color saturation of 255 but with half-maximum brightness of 128.

Twelve colors with maximum saturation and maximum brightness which span the spectrum of hues are:
