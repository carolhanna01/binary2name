@unnumbered 1 Introduction
GSEGrafix is a @uref{http://www.gnome.org, GNOME} application which uses an anti-aliased GNOME canvas for creating scientific and engineering plots. The program is written in C and reads ASCII parameter files and data files. The parameter files contain keywords and corresponding arguments for specifying plot parameters (such as data file names, data file formats, plot type, plot style, axis type, axis labels, etc). Operation of the program is described in more detail below. Eleven example plots, corresponding examples of @uref{http://www.octave.org, Octave} code or C code for creating the data files, and corresponding parameter files are included at the end of this document. Separate data files and parameter files are provided for Examples 1 and 7. These files can be copied and used to run the program. Links to these files are included in the descriptions of these two examples.

GSEGrafix can make rectangular two-dimensional plots (with linear, semilog, or loglog axes), histograms, polar-axis plots, and three-dimensional plots (with linear axes). Three-dimensional plots include points, contour, color, and mesh plots. Data for three-dimensional plots can also be used to create two-dimensional plots using contour lines or color to represent values of a third variable.

A menu bar at the top of the plot window allows users to save the plot to a file, send the plot to a printer, copy the plot to the GNU/Linux clipboard, change the axis limits of the plot, change the orientation of three-dimensional plots, and display mouse coordinates in the lower left corner of the plot window for two-dimensional plots. Supported file formats for saving the plot to a file are bmp (Windows Bitmap), jpeg (Joint Photographic Experts Group), and png (Portable Network Graphics).

All plots include options to add minor tick marks, grid, legend, text, and date-time string to the plot. Additional images can be added to a plot by specifying image file names and desired locations on the plot. Rectangular two-dimensional plots include a zoom capability using the mouse to specify a rectangle on the plot to expand. Hidden lines are removed from three-dimensional mesh and contour plots unless specified otherwise. The program calculates "nice" tick-mark labels for all plots.

The program has two executables, gsegrafix and gsegraf. The gsegrafix executable creates a window which can be used to choose a parameter file. This window is shown below:

@image{./figures/gsegrafix, , , , .png}

When the gsegrafix executable is run and a parameter file has been chosen, the gsegraf executable is called to create the plot window. An example plot window is shown below:

@image{./figures/window, , , , .png}

The program can also be run by using either the gsegrafix or gsegraf command followed by the name of a parameter file:

@example
$ gsegrafix /home/sab/gsegrafix/param_files/bessel_param.txt &
@end example

or:

@example
$ gsegraf /home/sab/gsegrafix/param_files/bessel_param.txt &
@end example

This help file can be displayed by using either the gsegrafix or gsegraf command followed by -h:

@example
$ gsegrafix -h
@end example

or:

@example
$ gsegraf -h
@end example

If the program's path is not included in the PATH environment variable, the path must be included in the commands listed above. However, if gsegrafix is used to choose the parameter file, then the program's path must be included in the PATH environment variable so that gsegraf will be found when gsegrafix calls it.

The program can also be installed on the desktop Panel. To add GSEGrafix to the Panel right-click in an unused area of the Panel and select @strong{Add to Panel @arrow{} Custom Application Launcher}. This will bring up a dialog box where the name of the application, the path (if needed) and name of the command that starts the application, and a comment describing the application can be entered. By clicking the Icon box a browser dialog box will appear where one can choose an appropriate icon. By default the installation process writes the GSEGrafix logo file, gsegrafix-logo.png, to /usr/local/share/pixmaps if the program is compiled and installed by the user. The logo file is written to /usr/share/pixmaps if the program is installed from an rpm file. Appropriate entries for the dialog box are:

@example
   Type: Application
   Name: GSEGrafix
Command: gsegrafix %f
Comment: Scientific and engineering plotting program
   Icon: /usr/local/share/pixmaps/gsegrafix-logo.png
@end example
