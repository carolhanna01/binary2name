gsegrafix-1.0.5
===============

   1. The 1000-character limit for parameter-file lines was removed; lines can
      now be any length. Parameters are written to constant-size arrays using
      strncpy or snprintf so that array limits are not exceeded.

   2. A version of xmalloc is now used instead of malloc so that the program
      will exit if memory limits are exceeded.

   3. Data files and parameter files for Examples 1 and 7 were added to the
      distribution for use in becoming familiar with the program. There are
      links to each of the files in the corresponding example descriptions.

   4. A configure script was added to the distribution.

   5. An xml help file, gsegrafix.xml, was added to the distribution.

gsegrafix-1.0.6
===============

   1. Changed method used to display xml help file.

   2. Added keyword, background_color, to enable the background color of the
      plot window to be specified as either "white", the default, or "black". If
      "black" is chosen, the plot box, tick marks, axis labels, title, and text
      are white.

   3. Added keyword, background_image, to enable a background image, such as a
      map, to be displayed in the plot box. The image can be scaled in four
      different ways by specifying one of the parameter values: center, fill,
      scale, or zoom.
