* More boards both educational and/or recreationnal.

* Boards idea:
  - memory game (find pairs) using the animals pixmaps (or others)
  - simple geometry: redo a symetrical drawing

* Better implementation of the status bar. 
  It needs to be contextual.

* Use thepixbuf animation feature for fishes instead of my own 
  animation implementation

* GCompris editor : It will let teachers/educators to create their
  own boards.
