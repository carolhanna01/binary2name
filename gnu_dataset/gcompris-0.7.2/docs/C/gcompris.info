Why GCompris
============

   GCompris intent is to provide a central location where a user can
find different kind of small educational content called 'boards'.

   Today there is already a lot of free software that provides a small
education content.  Unfortunatly, it is difficult to track, intall and
use them because they do not evolve at the same speed and offer their
own user interface.

   GCompris aims to provide a unique user interface that gives access
to different boards.

   GCompris is part of the GNU project.

User Manual
***********

Control
=======

   All controls are designed to be user friendly for the youngest. For
this reason, GCompris does not stick to the Gnome standard for user
interfaces.  GCompris is controlled with a mouse. It cannot be used
without a mouse or a pointer device.

Gameplay
========

Main window
-----------

   Once started, GCompris presents a graphical view that includes from
top to bottom:
  1. A menu.

     From the menu, you can Quit GCompris. There is also an entry where
     you can find the help.

  2. Boards icon list

     Each icon represent a board. When you move the mouse over them,
     they are highlighted and the name and description of the board is
     displayed in the board description area.

  3. "Boards description area"

     Display a small description of what the highlited board icon is
     about.  Note that the descriptions are internationalized which
     means translated in a target language (See *Note
     Internationalization Issues:: for more information on
     Internationalization).

  4. Control bar The control bar is always present in GCompris. This
     icons are contextual which means that when an icon is not
     meaningfull in a specific contect, it is disabled (NOT YET
     IMPLEMENTED).

     The control bar contains the icons from left to right:
       1. Help (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED) In some case, a board can be too
          complex to be described in the "Board description area". In
          this case this will provide access to the additionnal
          instructions.

       2. Level Some boards provide different level. The number of
          levels is board dependant.

       3. OK Some boards do not automatically detect that the child has
          finish the given task. Clicking here is similar to entering
          <RET> on the keyboard and thus the <RET> key is a shortcut.

       4. End

          End the current board if any, otherwise Exit GCompris.  When
          entered at the board menu level, it will create a dialog
          window to confirm the Exit of GCompris.



Starting a game
---------------

   At the menu level, just click on the board icon.

Ending a game
-------------

   In the control bar, select the right most icon.

Game status
-----------

Internationalization Issues
***************************

Is my language supported?
=========================

   GCompris is internationalized and today it already supports
different languages.

   To be sure you're one is done, you can check the 'po' directory
found within GCompris source package. If your language is translated,
it will contain a file of the form `fr.po' where fr means French.

   If your language is not supported, you can provide help by doing it
for GCompris. For instructions, contact the official project maintainer.

How to translate GCompris for my language
=========================================

   From the GCompris source file, get the file `gcompris.pot', copy it
to a file named `XX.po' where XX stands for your locale like 'it' for
Italian.

   Read the file, it contains all the english text found in GCompris.
You just need to write your translation in the empty area after each
Engish sentence.

   Then, send the translation the the GCompris maintainer. He/She will
add it into the next official release.

Why adding boards to GCompris
=============================

   If you have a game idea that you feel suitable for children, you can
create a new project, let's call it gIdea. If you start from scratch,
you will have to implement a menu, a status bar, user feedback mecanism
and so on.

   If gIdea is not a complex and huge program, it can be easier and
faster for you to implement your gIdea as a GCompris board.  This way,
you benefit from all the current infrastucture and can focus only on
your very Idea.

   For the end user, it is also easier to have a unique interface to a
bunch of different boards instead of having to install gIdea1 gIdea2
and so on.

   It is not the intent of GCompris to becomes a new programming
language. It is implemented in C and boards are implemented in C also.
Boards and GCompris dynamically linked at runtime (plugins) which makes
it possible to distribute new boards independently of the gcompris core.

   Current implementation is based on the Gnome Canvas widget (see
`http://www.gnome.org' documentations). The Gnome Canvas provides a
high level widget that free programmers of bitmap manipulation when
doing graphical application. In current implementation, it is not
possible to write boards using another widget. If it appears that the
Canvas is not powerfull enough, GCompris will have to be modified to
support other widgets.

   Another approach is to have smarter boards that can read data files
and behaves accordingly. In this case we can envision a GCompris board
editor that will let non programmer add content to GCompris. Since the
target of GCompris is definitly teachers and educators, this option
seems very promising. Note that following this track, the shape board
already receives its data through an XML file.

How to add boards to GCompris
=============================

The whole picture
-----------------

GCompris API
------------

   GCompris provides several sercices to boards developpers.  These
services are described in the file gcompris/gcompris.h

   * `GnomeCanvasItem *gcompris_set_background(GnomeCanvasGroup
     *parent, gchar *file);'

     Set the background image for your game. You can get help from
     gameutil.h to load the image.

   * `void gcompris_bar_set_level (GcomprisGame *gcomprisGame);'

     The user did fine and has to go to the next level.  Before calling
     it, `gcomprisGame->level' must be updated by the board.

   * `void gcompris_bar_set_timer (guint time);'

     The timer is a progress bar that is usually used to inform the user
     of were he/she is in the board. This value must be in the range 0
     to 'maxtimer' given with `bar_set_maxtimer()'

   * `void bar_set_maxtimer (guint time);'

     Set the max value of the progress bar.

   * `void gcompris_bar_set_message (const gchar *message);'

     Display a message in the status bar.


   So when you create a board, you must include gcompris/plugin.h to
have access to those methods (this is already included in
gcompris/gcompris.h).

   plugin.h also define the BoardPlugin structure. It is the heart of
GCompris. Each board creates its own BoardPlugin and give it back to
Gcompris when called in the get_bplugin_info() entry point:

   `BoardPlugin* *get_bplugin_info ();'

   The BoardPlugin returned structure must contains callbacks to your
implementation methods.

   The BoardPlugin structure must provide callbaks to at least:

   * `void *GcomprisStartBoard     (GcomprisBoard *gcomprisBoard);'

     This is called by GCompris when this board has been requested by
     the user

   * `void *GcomprisEndBoard      (void);'

     This is called by GCompris when the user clicked 'end' in the
     control bar.


   Optionnaly, a GComprisGame structure can contains callbacks to:

   * `gint *GcomprisKeyPress     (guint keyval);'

     If the board wants to receive user keypress, it must provide this
     callback method. The keyval is not filtered and is returned as
     Gnome return it. Check the Gnome documentation to understand how
     to manipulate it.

   * `void *GcomprisOK           (void);'

     This method is called when the user click the 'OK' button in the
     control bar. It is a good practice to make the enter and return
     key behaves as the 'ok' button, but it may not be always
     appropriate. For this reason, it is the responsibility of the
     board implementation to do it.

   * `void *GcomprisSetLevel     (guint level);'

     This is called with the level requested by the user.  You provide
     the maximum number of level you support in
     `gcomprisGame->maxlevel'.   Gcompris will take care to call it
     only with a valid level value.


Example of duplicating an existing board to create your own
-----------------------------------------------------------

   This describes all the steps required to add a new board to GCompris.

   As an example, I describe here how I created the clock game.

  1. Copy an existing game (closest to your new board).  `cp algebra.c
     clockgame.c'

  2. Edit src/boards/Makefile.am and add the file to the list of
     lib_LTLIBRARIES Then add at the end the entries for
     libclockgame_la_LDFLAGS, libclockgame_la_LIBADD and
     libclockgame_la_SOURCES. Look at examples in src/boards/Makefile.am
     to see how to do that.

  3. In clockgame.c replace all 'algebra' by 'clockgame'

  4. In clockgame.c set the proper information for the new game:

     `if(g_strcasecmp(gcomprisBoard->type, "clockgame")==0)'

     You must then create or copy the board description to the proper
     location

     `cp boards/algebra.xml boards/clockgame.xml'

     Then edit clockgame.xml with a proper description and icon.    Set
     the icon file at the location given in clockgame.xml.

  5. In boards/menu.xml add the entry point for the new game:

     `<Data filename="clockgame.xml"/>'

  6. make should compile everything fine.

  7. make install is mandatory or the icon won't be find at runtime.

  8. Now running gcompris should show up the new icon and you should be
     able to play the game you did copy. Now it's time to code the board
     in clockgame.c

  9. Update the po files:

     `cd gcompris/po'

     `edit POTFILES.in and add src/clockgame.c)'

     `make'

     `make update-po'

 10. Now you can add the translation in the po files.

 11. 'make' and then 'make install' will compile and install your
     translation.

******************************

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
