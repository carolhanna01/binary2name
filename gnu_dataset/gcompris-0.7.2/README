			 GCompris MOTIVATION

Big Issue:
  Today Linux does not have a lot of usefull educational tools for children.
  When they exist, they are hard to find and request the teacher/parent to
  manage a lot of independant small tools.


Big Goal:
  Build an educationnal game suite all accessible from a single user interface.
  GCompris provides a simple to use user interface that makes it easy select
  appropriate boards. 

How:
  GCompris is designed in a way that it is easy to add new boards to it.
  Today a board is called with the root canvas of the main window, and then 
  the board is free to implement the game scheme it wants.
  The status bar is a common facility provided to the board.

  To make GCompris a powerfull tool for all its users, the teachers,
  the children but also the developers, GCompris implements a plugin system
  where each board is an independant plugin. Then if the board requires it,
  the data set for this board is defined in an XML file.

  GCompris will provide a board editor to let teacher/educator easily add
  boards to GCompris.
