COPYING and USE

Use and distribution of this software is governed by your choice of one of 
two licensing schemes:  the GNU Library Public License or the "Artistic"
license.  See the COPYING.LIB and Artistic files for more information.


INSTALLATION

If you are using the DIS/x library as distributed with ACM, no
special actions are required on your part.  This library is intended
to be used independently of ACM, too.  This section describes build
procedures in that event.

Cd to the top-level directory (the one containing the README file that
you are currently viewing). Type:

	$ ./configure
	$ make

The SIM/x server software stores it's information in a dbm database.
Configure will attempt to use your system's native dbm library, provided it
can find it in one of the usual places.  If not, it punts and uses "SDBM".
SDBM was written by Ozan "Oz" Yigit (oz@nexus.yorku.ca).  It has been
integrated into this distribution in source form for your convenience.
If you feel like you'd want an updated copy of SDBM, try gatekeeper.dec.com.

And, because I used strcasecmp.c from the NetBSD software release:
