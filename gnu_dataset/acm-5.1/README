GNU ACM Flight Simulator

What is GNU ACM?
----------------

GNU ACM is a distributed aerial combat simulator that runs on the X
Windows System. Players can engage in simultaneous air combat from different
computers. Players fly jet aircraft (something close to either an
F-16C Falcon or a MiG-29 Fulcrum) equipped with radar, heat seeking missiles and cannon.

GNU ACM is a slighty modified version of the original ACM made by
Riley Rainey at WebSimulations.

Please look at the texinfo manual ('info acm') for more information.
