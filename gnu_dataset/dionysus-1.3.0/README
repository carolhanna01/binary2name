I am pleased to announce the version 1.3.0 release of Dionysus.

Dionysus is the GNU package for scientific constants and engineers parameters.

Even if the author has worked hardly and accurately on this project,
surely, some bugs are still present.

The GNU implementation of this program is brought to you by the
efforts of Jean Michel Sellier.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

To add new values in the database please refer to the documentation.
If you think your values are relevant and useful to other users
please contact me and I will glad to include them in the next
version of Dionysus.

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:

    jeanmichel.sellier@gmail.com

GNU Dionysus is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
