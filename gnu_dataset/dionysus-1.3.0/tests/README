This directory contains some usefull tests to check if dionysus works properly on your system.

Furthermore, those tests are usefull since they show how to include dionysus queries into several languages.

At the present time, one test is implemented in C. Please have a look to the sources of this test to see how things work.

to compile the test:
> cd C_src
> make

to run it:
> test ../databases/universal.ddb q value

Happy hacking!
