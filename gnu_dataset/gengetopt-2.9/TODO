SPECIFIC TASKS:

* Implement argument name. Instead using `-i INT', one could specify that
  `-i lines' will be printed when using `--help' (`-h').

* Reimplement `ARG_SHORT', `ARG_FLOAT', `ARG_LONGDOUBLE' and `ARG_LONGLONG'
  cases in `generate_main' function in `gm.c' in `GENERATE' section.
  Current implementation truncate values! (THIS IS IMPORTANT).

* Implement overflows and underflows checks in `generate_main' function in
  `gm.c' file, in `GENERATE' section.

* Implement `unsignedint', `unsignedshort', `insignedlong' and
  `unsingedlonglong' as argument types. You should work in `generate_main'
  function and `sample', `argsdef.h' and `scanner.lex' files.


GENERAL TASKS:

* Implement `enumerated' argument type.

* Implement `optional' argument.

* Implement `description' sentence in `sample'.

* Reorder option listing in `--help' (`-h') option. Should be: first short
  then long options, listed both by alphabetic order. Short options should be
  listed in the format: `-i INT'.

* Currently, each sentence in input end in the end of line. Implement each
  sentence end in ';', allowing multiline sentences.


FUTURE TASKS:

* Implement `multiple' options. This means: `./myprog --file=file1 --file=file2'
  should work if `file' is an `multiple' option.

* May be make a library (!).


The current maintainer is taking patches. See the file `AUTHORS'.

LORENZO
--------
if configure doesn't find getopt, it should say to the programmer
that we provide getopt.c getopt1.c and getopt.h, which will be installed
in $(prefix)/share/gengetopt

write texinfo documentation

Check if non-required options are all generated within [] when long
help is required

remove some rules in parser.y by using possible empty symbols
(such as argtype...)

yesno should really be required?  If not given could be inferred as "no".

in the conf file it should be possible to specify
opt-string "long string with spaces"
at the moment it is not recognized

MULTIPLE

test with two multiple options of the same type

maybe an explicit cast is needed for malloc?

check the indentation of the generated file for multiple options

update the documentation
