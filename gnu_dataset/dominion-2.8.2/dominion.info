1 Overview
**********

_Dominion_ is a multi-player world simulation game.  Each player is the
leader of a nation, and makes decisions for that nation.  The decisions
are political, military, diplomatic and economic, and all are extremely
important for the well-being of a nation.  Some nations can be played
by the computer.  These nations are called _CNs_ (Computer Nations).
They play a challenging game, and are quite useful if few human players
are available.

   Dominion has features from fantasy role-playing games, educational
games, and war games. A player needs to develop a character as the
leader of a nation, keep a healthy economy, and develop a strong
military force using magic or technology.

   The dominion world is broken up into small areas called _sectors_.
Each nation tries to occupy sectors and employ people in them.  The
nation's leader decides what the purpose of each sector should be, and
what the people in the sector will produce.

   All nation leaders possess a magical palantir which allows them to
communicate with each other.  Nations may send mail to each other, or
post publicly readable articles to various newsgroups.  Nations also
receive mail from the dominion game itself informing them of events in
their nation and the world.

   Each leader must try to obtain the resources needed to run his
nation, and use them wisely.  The main resources are _money_, _metal_,
and _jewels_. The unit of currency in Dominion is _sheckles_
(abbreviated sk.)  These resources can be spent for various things,
such as building cities, drafting armies, or hiring mages to perform
magic.  In addition, resources can be invested in technological or
magical research. This research will yield new technology which will
improve your nation, and new magic spells and spirits will become
available to your mages.

   Most of the moves you make are not resolved until the end of a turn,
when the _update_ is run.  This update will incorporate your changes
into the world database, then it will update your economy, handle
migration of people, resolve battles and conquest of land, and a few
other things.  You will receive mail informing you of what happened to
your nation during the update. The time elapsed between updates is
called a _thon_.

2 Getting and installing Dominion
*********************************

Dominion is available by anonymous ftp from `max.physics.sunysb.edu',
in the directory `/pub/dominion'.  As I write, the latest version there
is `dominion-2.8.2.tar.gz'. The URL for that is
`ftp://max.physics.sunysb.edu/pub/dominion/' and you should check which
the most recent version is in that directory.

   Dominion now follows the GNU coding standards, which means that the
installation is quite straightforward; you unbundle the software with
     gzcat dominion-version.tar.gz | tar xvf -

   Then you type
     ./configure --prefix=your-prefix-dir

   After which you can type
     make install

   After which you are ready to make a world with (`dom_make'), add the
computer nations with (`dom_add -f cns'), add human-played nations
(`dom_add') and do updates (`dom_udpate').

   The steps to make a new world can be abbreviated by running

     make new-world

   The gamemaster manual has more information on how the gamemaster can
run the game.

File: dominion.info,  Node: Choosing your nation,  Next: The screen display,  Up: Getting started

3.1 Choosing your nation
========================

Your nation is added to the game by the _Gamemaster_, or someone
trusted by the Gamemaster.  You get to choose the _name_ of your
nation, your _leader's name_, your _nation mark_, the _race_ of your
people, and the _magical order_ for your nation.

   Your nation mark is a single character which is used to denote your
territories on a map.  Most players try to use the first letter of
their nation name for this.  Each letter may only be used once however,
so you should have a few choices ready in case your preferred one is
already taken.  In some games the Gamemaster may assign nation marks to
nations.

   The choice of race plays a key role in dominion. Each race has
certain characteristics (dwarves are better miners; elves are more
intelligent, orcs reproduce like crazy, etc.) which will affect many
different aspects of your game. Also, the choice of race largely
determines the role you will play in the game. The different races
available in Dominion are described in section *Note Races::.

   Your magical order determines what spirits you can summon, and which
spells you may cast.  If you are planning on using much magic in
dominion, this choice should be made very carefully.  The different
magic orders are described in Section *Note Magic::.


File: dominion.info,  Node: The screen display,  Next: Moving around the map,  Prev: Choosing your nation,  Up: Getting started

3.2 The screen display
======================

When you first look at your nation in Dominion, you will see a screen
divided into four main sections.  The largest area of the screen is your
nation's sector map.  Each sector is represented on the screen by a
letter or symbol, with your sectors highlighted.  Your terminal's cursor
should be on the <C> in the center of the screen.

   Your sectors are described by a letter, which tells you the
designation of the sector.  This designation determines the purpose of
the sector.  The designations you might see at the beginning of a game
are <C>, which is your nation's capital, <m>, a metal mine, <j>, a jewel
mine, or <f>, a farm.  You can change these designations, and set the
designation of new sectors you occupy.  This will typically cost money,
and sometimes metal and jewels.

   The box in the lower right corner of the screen is the _sector
window_.  It gives a brief description of the sector that the cursor is
currently on.  The window tells you the sector's location, owner,
designation, and other important information.  All coordinates in
Dominion are displayed relative to your capital.

   Above the sector window is a list of armies.  This list gives brief
information about each army in the sector.  It is used to select
specific armies to move or manipulate.

   The bottom two lines of the screen are the status lines.  These lines
are used by dominion to display information or status messages, or to
get input from the player.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Moving around the map,  Next: Moving your armies,  Prev: The screen display,  Up: Getting started

3.3 Moving around the map
=========================

You can move the cursor to another sector on the map using the [h],
[j], [k], and [l] keys to move left, down, up, and right, and the keys
[y], [u], [b], and [n] to move diagonally.  This is similar to the
cursor movements in some editors (like _vi_), and some UNIX games (such
as _rogue_, _larn_, _nethack_, and _conquer_).  For large movements
across the map, you can use the _upper-case_ letters [H], [J], [K], and
[L].  These jump 8 sectors in the specified direction .(1)

   Alternatively, you may use the numeric keypad, in which case the
number keys move you in the same direction in which they point on the
keypad.  Both the ordinary keys and the numeric keypad can be used to
browse the map and to move armies.  The following diagram shows you the
directions and keys you can use.

                                    NORTH

3.4 Moving your armies
======================

Armies are manipulated with the [a]rmy menu.  Here are _some_ of the
army commands.  A complete list comes later.

*[l]ist*
     This will give you a list of army and navy types available for
     drafting. At the start, you should see _Cavemen_ and _Caravans_ in
     the list. As your technology improves, more army and navy types
     will become available.

*[n]ext army*
*[p]revious army*
     These pick the next and previous armies in the current sector,
     skipping armies that do not belong to you.  The currently selected
     army will be highlighted in the army list.

*[m]ove*
     After you have selected an army you want to move type [m] and move
     the cursor to where you want the army to be.  *Warning*: watch your
     army's _move points_ and the _move cost_ of each sector you cross:
     if you run out of move points your army might get stuck where you
     don't want it!

*[s]tatus:*
     This lets you change your army's status.  The status affects what
     your army will do in various situations.  The most basic statuses
     are:

    *[a]ttack*
          When in this mode your army will attack an enemy nation's
          army in the same sector.  This will happen only if you are at
          _war_ or _jihad_ with the other nation.

    *[d]efend*
          An army in defend status can not take a sector nor will it
          attack another army.  If attacked it will defend itself.

    *[o]ccupy*
          If you want to take a sector that is un-owned or owned by an
          enemy, you move an army of 100 or more soldiers to that sector
          and set its status to occupy.

*[d]raft*
     To draft an army or navy you must be in a city or capital that you
     own.  Drafting an army will cost metal and money, so be careful
     and watch how much you spend.  You will be given the list of
     available army types, (see [l]ist), and you must type the
     abbreviation for that army type.

3.5 Taking sectors
==================

At the beginning of the game, you should try to take many sectors: this
gives a safety buffer around your capital, and allows you to look for
resources in the new occupied lands.  You take sectors by moving an
army _of at least 100 soldiers_ to that sector and setting it on occupy
mode.  If the sector belongs to another nation, you will have to
declare war to take the sector from them.  You declare war using the
[r]eports menu, and choosing [d]iplomacy.

   Once you take a sector (it will become yours after the update), you
can redesignate that sector so it produces what you want.  For example,
redesignating to a farm will make that sector produce food.  Sector
designations are described in great detail later, but you should know
now that to change a designation you use the [Z]oom key to focus on the
specific sector, and then change the designation with the [r]edesignate
key.  You will be given a menu of possible designations.

   To help you choose a designation for the sectors you take, the sector
window shows you the _soil_, _metal_, and _jewels_ in that sector.  For
example, if the sector has a high metal yield, you might want to make a
_metal mine_ out of it.

   Below is an example of a sector window that shows a sector with
jewels 5, metal 0 and soil 6.  The sector belongs to nation Khazad Dum,
has coordinates (2, 2) relative to the current player, has 452
inhabitants which are of race (D), Dwarves.

                                     +----------------------+

File: dominion.info,  Node: Setting up your budget,  Next: Commands,  Prev: Taking sectors,  Up: Getting started

3.6 Setting up your budget
==========================

It is important that you set up your budget properly. Do this by
choosing the [r]eports menu, and then the [b]udget report.  Here you
choose your tax rate, and the amount of money, metal, and jewels you
wish to invest in various types of research.  A note about taxes: if
your taxes are too high, your production of food, metal and jewels will
decrease.

   There are default values set for investment in magic and technology,
and there is a default tax rate.  This is intended to guide new players
through their first moves.

   The _Breakdown of Expenditures_ in the report shows how much of each
thon's _revenue_ you are investing in various things.  You can also
spend a fraction of your _reserves_ on various types of research, by
selecting the [s]torage option. This amount will be reset to 0 after
each update. The report also shows you how much of each resource you
are spending, and your predicted resources for next thon.

   The budget report is explained in more detail in Section *Note
Budget report::.

4.1 Races
=========

There are many races available to players in dominion, and each Game
Master can add new races by modifying the race descriptor file.  This
should not be done lightly however, as the parameters describing each
new race must be carefully tuned to preserve game balance.  The races
currently available are Elf, Human, Dwarf, Orc, Merfolk, Icefolk,
Hobbit, Gnome, Harpy, Ogre, Walrus, Algae, and Squid.

* Menu:

* Race parameters::
* Race table::
* Land-water interaction::


File: dominion.info,  Node: Race parameters,  Next: Race table,  Up: Races

4.1.1 Race parameters
---------------------

The parameters describing your race are strength, reproduction rate,
mortality rate, intelligence, speed, stealth, preferred altitude,
vegetation, and temperature, and aptitude for magic, farming and mining.

   In addition to these parameters, some races have certain special army
types available to them.  For example, Harpies can draft armies of type
"Harpy" which can fly.  The army types table (Table *Note Army types::)
lists the race specific armies and their characteristics.

   Some of the races (Merfolk, Walrus, Algae, and Squid) live under
water.  The game is almost symmetrical for races that live above and
below water. Races that live above and below water can interact (and
fight) in several ways, as described below.

   Each of the above parameters affect the races in the following ways:

_Strength_
     affects your combat bonus.

_Reproduction_
     the rate at which people are born in your nation.

_Mortality_
     every year this percentage of your population dies.

_Intelligence_
     affects your acquisition of technological skill, and also helps in
     combat.

_Speed_
     affects your armies' move points.

_Stealth_
     affects your spy and secrecy skills.

_Preferred altitude, vegetation, and temperature_
     these affect migration of people, and the move cost of sectors.
     For example, if your race prefers high altitude, mountains will
     have less move cost.

_Magic aptitude_
     this affects how quickly you learn the spells for your chosen
     magical order, and how many spell points you gain.

_Farming_
     your farms produce this percentage more than their basic
     productivity.  This will increase during the game, as you acquire
     new technology.

_Mining_
     your metal and jewel mines produce this percentage more than their
     basic productivity.  This will increase during the game as you
     acquire new technology.

   The parameters for each race available in dominion can be found in
*Note Race table:: below.

* Land-water interaction::


File: dominion.info,  Node: Land-water interaction,  Prev: Race table,  Up: Races

4.1.3 Land-water interaction
----------------------------

For the most part, land races operate on land and water races in the
water.  However, each can extend its influence to the other side of the
sea level in various ways.  Some armies have special flags which
indicate whether they travel in land, water, or both.

   Ships have the _inverse altitude_ flag, <I>, which means that when
owned by a land race, ships travel on water.  For a water race, ships
travel on land.

   If a land nation would like to occupy sectors in the water it can do
so using armies which have the _water_ flag, <W>, such as _Swimmers_ or
_Scuba_divers_. Similarly, a water race can occupy land sectors using
armies such as _Walkers_ which have the _land_ flag, <L>.  Notice that
any other army or spirit with the <W> and <L> flags will work fine.  An
army with both the <L> and <W> flags, such as the magical _Sea Serpent_
can travel anywhere.

   Some of the army types mentioned above have the _front line_ flag,
<f>. This means that they can be unloaded from a ship onto an unowned
sector.  Armies without this flag can only be unloaded onto land
already owned by you.

   Once the sector is occupied you cannot move people into it or they
will drown (or suffocate if you are a water nation).  You can, at great
expense, build a _bubble_ over the sector or cast a _change altitude_
spell on it which will allow your people to move into it, even if it is
a water (or land) sector.  This provides a means for colonizing the
oceans (continents).

4.2 Technology
==============

A nation starts with very low skills in mining and farming. These
skills can be developed by investing money or metal in technological
research and development (R&D).  This investment is made in the budget
report.  Increases in technology depends on how much metal and money
you invest each thon.  Metal increases technology proportional to the
_3/4 power_ of the amount invested; money increases technology
proportional to the _square root_ of the amount of money invested.
This means that doubling your metal investment will promote your
technology research much more than doubling your money will.

   With each new technology you develop, you can gain certain things.
For example, _fire_ technology increases your nation's mining ability,
decreases your people's mortality rate, and increases their farming
ability.  With new technology you can also gain the ability to draft
new types of armies.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Magic,  Next: Designations,  Prev: Technology,  Up: The Dominion world

4.3 Magic
=========

Your nation is initiated to one of the magic orders available.  Each
order is characterized by the set of _spells_ known to that order, and
a set of _spirits_ that can be summoned by mages of that order.  When
you are initiated as a national leader you know only a little of the
magic of that order, but you can increase your knowledge by investing
money and jewels into magical research.  As you invest more and more,
your magic skill will increase, and you will learn more advanced
spells, and how to summon more powerful spirits.  This investment is
made with the budget report.

   Your magic skill increase is proportional to the jewels invested in
magic research, and to the square root of the money you invest.  As
with technology, this means that investing jewels will improve your
magic skill more than investing money will.

   In addition, some magical orders bring a set of characteristics to
its initiates.  These are described below in the descriptions of the
individual magic orders.

4.3.1 Spell points
------------------

To _use_ magic, that is, to cast spells and summon spirits, you must
acquire _spell points_. You get spell points in proportion to the
amount of jewels you invest in magical R&D, but _not_ from your money
investment.  Your budget report indicates how many spell points you
will earn from your jewel investment.

   *Please note:* spell points do _not_ accumulate: if you don't use
your spell points, two thirds of them will be lost the next thon. It is
advisable to use all the spell points made in a thon, or to wait and
save up jewels and then invest them all at once.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Mages,  Next: Magic Orders,  Prev: Spell points,  Up: Magic

4.3.2 Mages
-----------

Mages are necessary for casting spells and summoning spirits.  They must
be initiated inside a capital, city, temple or university.  They cost
5000 jewels to initiate, and 1000 jewels in maintainance each thon.
Mages are moved around as if they were an army, and have twice the
nation's basic move rate. Some spirits have the _wizardry_ flag, and
they behave like mages.

   You need to bring a mage to a certain sector to cast a spell in it or
to summon a spirit there, so you should make sure you initiate some
mages to work for your nation once you are ready to use magic.  They
cost a lot to initiate and maintain, but are worthwhile.

   If a mage is on a sector where there is a battle, he will try to stay
out of the battle.  If 85% of the mage's accompanying force is killed,
however, he will be killed also.

   See section *Note Wizardry:: on the [W]izardry command for details on
using magic.

4.3.3 Magic Orders
------------------

The basic magic orders in dominion are:

*Aule*
     Aule is the god of the earth, and is interested in all that
     happens in the depths of the earth.  He protects miners and
     workers of metal and stone, and gives them an extra 10% mining
     skill.

*Avian*
     This order allows you to summon spirits related to the air.

*Chess*
     This order allows you to summon spirits similar to those on the
     chessboard in their movements and strength.

*Demonology*
     his is concerned with the conjuring of demons.

*Diana*
     This order is concerned with animals and hunting.

*Inferno*
     This order is concerned with power through fire.

*Monsters*
     This order has available many monstrous creatures.

*Necromancy*
     Necromancy is concerned with the invocation of dead and undead
     spirits.  Nations of this order start with their mortality rate
     increased by 2%.

*Neptune*
     Neptune is the god of the oceans, and his order is concerned with
     the waters.

*Time*
     This order steps back to the age of the dinosaurs.

*Unity*
     This order has spirits that combine different creatures in one
     body.

*Yavanna*
     Yavanna is the godess of plants, and everything that grows and is
     fertile is under her protection.  Yavanna gives her initiates an
     extra 50% farming skill.

*Insects*
     This order has spirits from the insect world.  The order gives a
     nation 1% extra reproduction.


   The Game Master can add other magical orders to the game by inserting
a list of spirits for that order into a file.

4.3.4 Magic Spells
------------------

Here is a description of several spells available in dominion.  Keep in
mind that some spells may be available to several orders, and their
cost and duration will be different for the different orders.

   Both the cost and the duration of the spell are indicated when you
list your available spells.  The cost is in spell points.  If the spell
is applied to a sector, then that cost is all you spend.  A spell
applied to an army will usually set a special flag for that army, and
will cost the given amount per 100 men.  Army flags are described in
the section on armies.

   Notice that some armies and spirits come into the world with some of
these magical properties already set, so you do not need to set them
with a spell.

_caltitude_
     is spell allows you to raise or lower the altitude of a sector.
     This means that you could plunge it into the sea, or place it on a
     mountain peak.

_cfertility_
     is spell allows you to raise or lower the soil fertility of a
     sector.

_cmetal_
     is spell allows you to raise or lower the metal productivity of a
     sector.

_cjewels_
     is spell allows you to raise or lower the jewel productivity of a
     sector.

_fireburst_
     is spell devastates the chosen sector, redesignates it to _none_,
     and sets the soil productivity to zero.

_inferno_
     This spell will kill all population in the sector, and make it
     completely impenetrable to any army for its duration.  You can only
     cast _inferno_ on your own sectors.  It is a very effective way to
     block enemy armies.

_hide_sector_
     This spell completely hides the current sector from any other
     nation.  The sector will just appear as a blank spot on the map.

_hide_army_
     This spell sets the _hidden_ flag on an army.

_fly_army_
     This sets the _flying_ flag on an army.

_vampire_army_
     This sets the _vampire_ flag on an army.

_burrow_army_
     This sets the _underground_ flag on an army.

_water_walk_
     This sets the _water_ or _land_ flag on an army.  It allows armies
     which normally walk on land to also travel in water, and vice
     versa.

_mag_bonus_
     This gives magical enhancement to an army.  The army will fight
     with an extra 30% bonus.

_merge_
     This spell allows you to merge civilians into spirits (up to twice
     the spirits' basic strength), or to take spirits and merge them
     into the civilian population of a sector.

_haste_army_
     This spell adds the army's basic move rate to its current move
     points.  This has the effect of doubling the move points of an
     army in its normal state.

4.3.5 Spirits
-------------

Spirits are like armies, in that they can fight, and they can occupy
sectors (if they are big enough), and their status and movement is
manipulated with the [a]rmy command.

   They are also different in many ways.  To obtain spirits, your mage
summons them with spell points.  They are maintained by spell points
each thon (typically 1/3 of the spell points that were needed to summon
them in the first place).

   If you don't have enough spell points to support your spirits some of
them will become uncontrolled (see flags) so that you have enough spell
points to control the rest.  Uncontrolled spirits cost no maintanence,
but they will be disbanded over the next update if there is not enough
maintainance for all of the spirits the nation has.

   The spirit types for different magic orders are listed in *Note
Spirit tables::.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Designations,  Next: Economy and natural resources,  Prev: Magic,  Up: The Dominion world

4.4 Designations
================

If you own a sector, you can _redesignate_ it.  This specifies what
function that sector has.  When you first occupy an unowned sector, its
designation will be <x> (none).  It costs a certain amount of money,
and possibly metal or jewels, to redesignate a sector.

   Each type of sector can employ a different number of people.  For
example, a city can employ several thousand people, whereas a farm can
only properly employ a few hundred people.  The _basic maximum_ number
of people that a sector can employ is listed in *Note Designations::
below.  This value is then modified by how much your race tends to
crowd.  If you are an orc, for example, more people can be crammed into
a single sector. The formula to account for crowding is:
max_employed = sector_max * sqrt(reproduction / 10).

   The more people you have in a sector, the more tax revenue it
supplies, and the more of the sector's product is produced.  A metal
mine with 200 people working will produce twice as much metal and tax
as a mine with 100 people.  If there are more people than the maximum
employable, the rest will be unemployed, and will produce nothing.
However, they will of course continue to consume food, so it is a good
idea to try to limit the unemployment in your nation.

   The possible designations (together with the characters that are
displayed on the map) are:
*Farm (`f')*
     produces food.  Without farmers producing food, your people will
     starve to death.

*Metal mine (`m')*
     supplies your country with metal, proportional to how good the
     metal mine is and your mining ability.

*Jewel mine (`j')*
     supplies your country with jewels, proportional to how good the
     jewel mine is and your mining ability.

*City (`c')*
     generates a lot of revenue in the form of taxes.  Cities are also
     the places in which you can draft armies and build ships.  Cities
     contain temples, so mages can be initiated in them, and cities are
     places of trade, so caravans can drop their goods in cities.

*Town (`T')*
     a small city in which you can carry out trade, but not drafting or
     magic.

*Capital (`C')*
     a city, but the administrative bureaucracy of your nation is based
     in your capital, so if your capital is sacked (occupied by an enemy
     nation), many of your nation's riches will be taken.

*University (`u')*
     this is a school of higher education.  Your country's intelligence
     can be increased if you put a lot of people in universities.
     Universities are costly to maintain.

*Temple (`+')*
     a place of worship.  Mages can be initiated in temples.  Also, the
     fraction of your people in temples increases your magic skill.

*Fort (`!')*
     forts give bonus to armies camped there (3/turn).

*Hospital (`h')*
     hospitals affect birth and death rates in your nation. (not yet)
     Hospitals have maintainance costs each turn.

   *Note Designations::, the _Designation table_, describes the
properties of various designations: what they cost, how much revenue
they produce per capita, how much money they cost to maintain, the
minimum employment (not used in all cases), and how many people can be
employed in that sector.

4.5 Economy and natural resources
=================================

The pillars of your economy are money and natural resources (soil
fertility, metal and jewels).  How you procure these and use them plays
a major role in dominion.

* Soil fertility::
* Metal::
* Jewels::


File: dominion.info,  Node: Money,  Next: Soil fertility,  Up: Economy and natural resources

4.5.1 Money
-----------

You get money by levying taxes.  You set the tax rate in the budget
screen.  Set the tax rate wisely to encourage entrepreneurship in your
nation. Production of food, metal and jewels decrease in proportion to
your tax rate.  Money is spent for redesignating sectors, drafting and
maintaining armies, research and development, supporting universities
and hospitals, and many other things.

* Menu:

* Debt::


File: dominion.info,  Node: Debt,  Up: Money

4.5.1.1 Debt
............

[*NOTE:* the section on bonds described here is not yet implemented;
for now a debt simply means negative money]

   If your nation's money balance goes negative, you will be forced to
issue bonds to your population to finance the debt (this happens
automatically over the update, so there is no way you can plummet into a
negative balance).  You must then pay an interest on these bonds.

   At any time you can also negotiate for other nations to purchase your
bonds.  Interest rate on domestic bonds is fixed (15%/thon), but you can
negotiate the price for bonds issued to other countries.

   If you want to finance a big war, and need lots of cash fast, the
best way to go is probably to issue a lot of bonds to other countries.

   The bonds your nation issues must always be backed by your reserve
of jewels.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Soil fertility,  Next: Metal,  Prev: Money,  Up: Economy and natural resources

4.5.2 Soil fertility
--------------------

Your nation must produce the food necessary to feed its people and
soldiers. This is done by designating certain sectors to be farms.
These farms will be more productive if they are on sectors with a
better soil parameter.

   Your farming skill also determines how productive your farms will be.
You can increase your farming skill with research in technology, because
your nation will discover better tools and methods for farming.

   If your food production is insufficient, your reserves will be used.
If those are not enough, you had better arrange to purchase some, or
that part of your civilians who did not get enough food will starve.
Once all your civilians have starved, your armies will start to starve.
It is also important to know that soldiers eat slightly more food each
thon than people.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Metal,  Next: Jewels,  Prev: Soil fertility,  Up: Economy and natural resources

4.5.3 Metal
-----------

Metal represents all metals and materials used for practical purposes,
such as construction and armaments.  It is found in metal mines.  The
production of each mine is greater if the sector has a higher metal
parameter, and is also increased by your nation's mining skill.  Your
mining skill can increase if you invest in technology, because your
nation will discover better tools for mining and prospecting.

   You can spend your metal in several ways, including drafting armies,
technological R&D, and constructing fortification and roads.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Jewels,  Prev: Metal,  Up: Economy and natural resources

4.5.4 Jewels
------------

In dominion, Jewels represent all kinds of rare resources, such as
jewels, gold, silver, platinum, pearls, and so on.  Jewels are found in
jewel mines.  How many jewels you produce in a mine depends on the
jewels parameter of that sector, and also on your mining ability (see
section on metal).

   Jewels are very important, because they can be invested in magical
research, and are used to get spell points.  In fact, your spell points
depend only on the amount of jewels you invest in magical R&D.

   Jewels are also important in that they constitute your nation's
reserve that backs up its currency and bonds.  When you issue bonds,
these have to be backed up by jewels, so it is a good idea to save some
jewels, and not spend them all. (note: bonds are not yet implemented)

   (We must find another use for jewels, so nations have more choices to
make in spending jewels.)


File: dominion.info,  Node: Transportation and trade,  Next: Communications,  Prev: Economy and natural resources,  Up: The Dominion world

4.6 Transportation and trade
============================

You can trade with other nations or just transport goods/armies/people
for your own benefit, using _ships_ and _caravans_.  Caravans travel on
land, whereas ships travel in the water. (For water based nations, the
inverse is true.)

   Ships and caravans are drafted as if they were armies, and appear in
your [l]ist of available armies in the [a]rmy menu.  The construction
and maintainance costs of ships and caravans are tabulated with those
of other army types.  Note that some spirits also behave as ships and
caravans, in that they have the _cargo_ flag.  Examples of this are the
_flying carpet_, the _ghost ship_ and the _living ship_.

   A single cargo hold can only transport a certain amount of goods.
The unit of weight is _the weight of a single person_, and a caravan
can transport 250 person weights.  A bar of metal weighs 0.1, money
weighs 0.01 for a sheckel, food 0.05, a jewel basket 0.01.  If you load
soldiers, their weight is equal to the weight of the number of people
plus the weight of the metal used in drafting the army.  Any caravan
can transport only a single army and a single land title.  The land
title does not have significant weight.

   To load a caravan or navy, you select it (with [a]rmy commands) and
then use the [t]ransportation command to [l]oad goods, which can be
[s]hekels (money units), [m]etal, [f]ood, [p]eople, [a]rmy or [t]itle.
To unload it you move the caravan or navy to its destination and do the
same with [u]nload instead of [l]oad.

   You can only load certain goods onto a caravan in certain places.
Anything can be loaded in a city (or your capital).  Metal can also be
loaded in metal mines, jewels in jewel mines and food in farms.  The
title to a sector _must_ be loaded in that sector itself.  People can
be loaded from any of your own populated sectors.  Armies can be loaded
anywhere in your land, but out of your territory they can only be
loaded if they have the front-line flag.

   To unload in a foreign land you must be in a city or town.  The only
exception is that you can unload armies with the front-line flag
anywhere.  To _trade_ an army in a foreign city or town, you should put
the army in _traded_ status, and then unload it in the city or town.

   Alternatively, since armies move on their own, you can put them on
_traded_ status and just walk them up to the city or town.  When you
stop that army on the foreign city or town, you will be asked if you
really want to trade it.  You can also change the army to _traded_
status once it is already at the city or town.

   If you have unloaded goods or armies into a foreign nation's city or
town, the goods or armies will become theirs.  During the update, each
nation will receive mail which indicates what trades occurred.

   Transporting goods within your country is not really useful.
However, transporting people is an effective way of getting them to the
better mines and farms.  Transporting armies can help mobilize your
forces more quickly, since you can then unload them and they can still
march.

   Some armies, such as Sailors and Marines, have the _front line_ flag
(see the army types table).  This means that they can be unloaded from
caravans and ships anywhere: in your land, in un-owned land, and in
foreign land.  Thus ships and caravans can be used for transportation
of fighting troops, not just for trade and migration.

   If a transport (caravan or ship) is on a sector where there is a
battle, it will be destroyed if more than 85% of its accompanying force
is killed.  Otherwise it will be left intact.  If an army is on a
transport and a battle occurs, the army's bonus is modified by the
bonus of the transport.  Thus, if 100 soldiers with bonus 30 are on a
sailboat which has bonus -50, and are in a battle, their bonus will be
-20.

4.7 Communications
==================

Nations in dominion communicate through _mail_ and _news_.  Mail allows
you to send personal messages to leaders of other nations.  News is for
general announcements, and is read by all nations.

   There can be several newsgroups.  One is always reserved for messages
from the computer, containing general information on what has happened
over the update.  This newsgroup is usually called "News".  Other
newsgroups are set up by the Game Master, and any nation leader can
post to them.  At Stony Brook we usually have a newsgroup called
"public" which receives many very creative postings from participants.

   You should read your mail and news whenever you play your turn, to be
in touch with your neighbours and the rest of the world.  You also get
mail from the update program after each update, telling you what has
changed in your nation over the update.  Alternatively, you can tell
dominion to forward your mail, news, or both, to an electronic mail
address using the [O]ptions menu.

4.8 World Geography
===================

The world is shaped like a torus (i.e. the surface of a doughnut).
This is the best approximation of a sphere which can be displayed
easily on a flat terminal.

   Thus, the world wraps in both the north-south and east-west
directions. So, if you are playing in a 100x100 world, and your nation
grows to be 100 sectors wide, you can travel around the world.

4.8.1 Terrain
-------------

There are various types of terrain.  They affect how fast a race can
move on a sector, and are related to the food production of that sector.
We define _terrain_ to mean what covers the surface of that sector.
You find a sector's terrain described in the sector window, in the
sector [Z]oom window, and in the [t]errain [d]isplay.  The Terrains

4.8.2 Altitude
--------------

A sector's altitude greatly affects how fast races move on that sector.

   The altitudes in Dominion range from Ocean Trenches to Mountain
Peaks.  You find a sector's altitude described in the sector window, the
sector [Z]oom window, and the [A]ltitude [d]isplay.

   You also see the altitude marks for un-owned lands on the ordinary
designation map display (the default display when you start playing).

   The Altituted table lists the altitudes together with the marks that
appear on the map and the numbers that give the ordering.  Notice that
altitude 0 is sea level, and is considered land.

5 Diplomacy and war
*******************

Diplomatic relations with your neighbours are extremely important.  Your
nation could be destroyed if you do not properly set your diplomacy: you
might make several enemies who could then form a treaty to fight you.
This happens quite often.

   Your nation starts out with 10 armies of 100 Cavemen each in your
capital; more can be drafted using the [a]rmy menu.  Soldiers are used
to occupy unowned land, to defend your own territory, and also to
conduct war against enemy nations.

   To occupy an unowned sector, you must have an army of at least 100
soldiers there, set on occupy mode.  To occupy a sector owned by
another nation, you have to declare _war_ or _jihad_ with them.
Sectors can also be occupied by spirits with 100 units or more.  If you
occupy an enemy's sector that has people on it, they will be hostile
toward you for one thon.  This means that you will not be able to draft
from the sector or redesignate it.

5.1 Diplomatic status
=====================

In the [r]eports menu, you can access your [d]iplomacy report.  This
report shows your status toward other countries, and their status
toward you.  You start out _UNMET_ with all nations.  Then, as your
armies come close to their sectors, or vice-versa, the two nations will
meet and be put in neutral status.

   You can change your status toward other countries as you meet them.
Many statuses are possible, but the most important ones are:

*Allied*
     this gives permission to the other nation to pass through your
     land at a lower move cost.  Also, you can put your armies in
     GARRISON in allied land, and they will get 1/2 of the GARRISON
     bonus.

*Treaty*
     this goes beyond ALLIED: if your armies or those of the other
     nation are involved in a battle, and the other has armies on the
     same sector, the two will fight together.  Also, if you put your
     armies in GARRISON in treaty land, they will get the full GARRISON
     bonus.

*War*
     if any army of yours is on the same sector as an enemy army, and
     one of the two is on ATTACK or OCCUPY mode, there will be a battle.

*Jihad*
     for now, this is the same as WAR.  In the future, JIHAD should
     involve some expense, and give a better fighting bonus due to
     fanatism in combat.

   You can change your diplomatic status towards any nation you have
met.  They will see the change immediately.  You can only change it by
two degrees each thon, so that you cannot be ALLIED, march into
someone's land, and then declare WAR and occupy all their sectors.

5.2 Armies
==========

The _army types_ table lists the various types of armies, their costs,
bonuses and move rates.

   Each army or spirit has a set of _army flags_ that affect its
behaviour.  Some are innate abilities of that army, others can be set
with magic spells.  The table lists each army's innate flags.  The flag
abbreviations are:

_F - Flying_
     Any army with this flag can fly.  Move costs of sectors don't
     depend on altitude, and thus are much lower.  These armies also
     ignore PATROLs and INTERCEPTs unless the patrolling army has
     missiles.

_H - Hidden_
     An army with this flag is magically cloaked.  Other nations will
     not be able to see the army on their maps.

_V - Vampire_
     An army with this flag will possess some of the dead on the
     battlefield who will join ranks with the army.

_T - Transport_
     This army is being transported as cargo.

_^ - Missiles_
     This army has weapons that are thrown, such as arrows. Archers are
     a type of army with missles.  These units, when in PATROL or
     INTERCEPT status, will slow down flying units too (normally flying
     units are not slowed down by PATROLs or INTERCEPTs, though they
     _do_ get intercepted once they land).

_W - Water_
     An army with this flag must stay in water, or in the land sectors
     along a coast; even if it belongs to a land nation.  Compare with
     the L flag below.

_L - Land_
     This is the exact inverse of the W flag.  An army with this flag
     must stay on land, or in water sectors along the coast; even if it
     belongs to a water nation.  Notice that if you have both the L and
     W flags, you can move that army onto _any_ sector on the map.

_I - Inverse altitude_
     This flag says that the army will have either the L or the W flag,
     depending on the race of the army's owner.  If the army belongs to
     a _land_ race, then it will have a W flag, and vice-versa.  This
     flag is used mostly for things like ships, which travel in the
     "inverse" altitude medium.

_f - Front-line_
     Army can be loaded/unloaded on/from a ship or caravan on land that
     does not belong to you.

_k - Kamikaze_
     Armies with this flag will fight with very high bonus, but will
     all die in any battle.

_m - Machine_
     These armies are really machines, such as siege engines, war carts
     and catapults.  They help ordinary armies in combat by destroying
     fortifications and adding bonus to the armies.

_d - Disguised_
     You can disguise this army so that it will appear to be of another
     type to other players.  For example, to disguise a poltergeist as
     an areal serpent you would change the army's _name_ so that it
     ends with "/areal_serpent".

_w - Wizard_
     This flag means that the army can summon spirits and cast spells,
     like a mage.

_s - Sorcerer_
     This flag means that the army can excercise powers of sorcery (not
     implemented yet).

_c - Cargo_
     This army can transport cargo, like ships and caravans.

_U - Underground_
     This army can burrow underground, and thus is not slowed down by
     patrols and intercepts.

_u - Uncontrolled_
     This means you have lost control of the army or spirit, usually by
     not having enough spell points available to support a spirit.
     Uncontrolled armies have no movepoints, have their status's set to
     neutral, and will not prevent an opposing force from taking a
     sector.  As well uncontrolled armies will be dibanded in not
     brought under control within one thon.

_R - Race specific_
     These armies are available only to certain races.  Race specific
     armies have a fixed bonus related to their original race and are
     unaffected by improving technology, and sometimes they have
     special flags (for example, Hobbits are hidden).  They are
     available from the start of the game, and are much more powerful
     than Cavemen, so they present a strong advantage.  When traded,
     these armies keep their special characteristics and their bonus;
     they will not acquire the strength of the nation to which they are
     traded.

_* - Magic order specific_
     These armies are available only to certain magic orders.

_Legion_
     A sophisticated form of Infantry with much higher bonus.  They
     become available with higher technology and cost barely more than
     infantry to draft; metal and maintainance are the same.  Once you
     have Legion available, there is no reason to continue drafting
     Infantry.

_Phalanx_
     Not yet very well inserted into Dominion.  They should in
     principle have greater strength in numbers, but this is not yet
     implemented.

_Elite_
     Cost a lot of metal and no money to draft and maintain; they are
     best used if you have too much metal and are bankrupt.

_Ninja_
     Good for spying, but cost too much in jewels to make them
     effective as large armies.

5.4 Army maintenance costs
==========================

Each army has a maintenance cost in money, metal, and/or jeweles, which
is for the salaries of the soldiers and upkeep of weapons and other
materials needed by the army.  The maintenance cost for each army is
given in the _army types_ table.  There is also a fixed per-army
overhead of 2000 sk.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Movement points,  Next: Army statuses,  Prev: Army maintenance costs,  Up: Diplomacy and war

5.5 Movement points
===================

Your armies can move only a certain distance before they must stop and
rest.  How much they can move is expressed in the army's _move points_,
and the _move cost_ of the sectors they cross.

   For example, if an army has 13 move points, and it goes through
sectors with move costs of 4, 3, and 4, it will have two move points
left.  It will only be able to move onto a sector with move cost of two
or less.


File: dominion.info,  Node: Army statuses,  Prev: Movement points,  Up: Diplomacy and war

5.6 Army statuses
=================

*[i]ntercept*
     This army will intercept a nearby enemy army.  Intercept raises
     the move cost of adjacent sectors, and then (over the update) the
     army will move to any adjacent sector where an enemy army might be
     located.  This is quite powerful, since you don't have to defend
     each square, but you should be careful because intercepts can be
     decoyed.  An army must have at least 50 soldiers to intercept.

     Intercept will also move the army to intercept a flying enemy army,
     once it has landed.  But the increased move cost will not apply to
     flying enemy armies _unless_ the intercepting army wields missiles
     (for example, archers).  See the description of army flags.

*[p]atrol*
     This army will patrol the area, raising the move cost of adjacent
     sectors for enemy armies.  If the enemy army is flying, the move
     cost will only be raised if the patrolling army has missiles (for
     example, archers).  An army must have at least 50 soldiers to
     patrol.

*[g]arrison*
     This army garrisons the sector, getting an extra 20 bonus on your
     own land.  If the sector belongs to a nation at _treaty_ with you,
     then you also get bonus 20.  If it is _allied_ land, you get a
     bonus of 10.

*[n]eutral*
     This army is neutral and will not involve itself in any conflicts
     that occur.  You cannot choose this status, it is assigned
     automatically to any army or spirit that becomes uncontrolled.

File: dominion.info,  Node: Options menu,  Next: Display menu,  Up: Detailed description of commands

6.1 Options menu
================

You can set some options that affect the way the game appears to you.
The [O]ptions menu allows you to set the following options:

*e[x]pert mode*
     This toggles expert mode on and off.  Expert mode allows an
     experienced player to do things much more quickly by showing most
     menus on the status line, instead of drawing windows.

*[f]orwarding mail*
     This allows a you to get mail forwarded to your e-mail account
     instead of reading mail inside dominion.

*[n]ews forwarding*
     This allows a you to have all of the news posted to the game to be
     forwarded to the mail address you specify.  You will still be able
     to read news inside dominion.

*[c]ivilian movement*
     This toggles between the three available types of migration that
     your government allows: _Free_, _Restricted_ and _None_.  These
     are described in section *Note Migration:: on migration.

*[m]ail program*
     This allows you to choose a mail program with which to read your
     dominion mail.  Examples are "elm", "mush", "Mail", or "mailx".
     If you type nothing, you will get the built-in bare-bones mail
     program.

*[e]ditor program*
     This allows you to choose your default editor and to overide any
     environment variables you may have set.  If the gamemaster has a
     restricted list of usable editors then it will tell you which
     editors you may choose from.

6.2 Display menu
================

The [d]isplay menu allows you to change what information is given on
the sector map.  The default view of the screen shows the designation
of your own sectors, altitude markings for unowned sectors, and nation
marks for other nations' sectors.  If you are a land nation, all water
sectors are marked as a "~", and if you are a water nation, land
sectors are marked by a ".".  Land nations may view underwater sectors,
and vice versa, with the [W]ater toggle option in the [d]isplay menu.
There are many other ways of looking at the map, and of highlighting
sectors on it.  These are described briefly here.

*Map Style*

    *[c]ompact*
          This will remove the spaces between sectors in the display,
          allowing you to see twice as much on the map.

    *[r]egular*
          This will display the map with a space between sectors.

*Display Options*
     Most of these simply display characters or numbers based on which
     you choose (for example, _[n]ation mark_ will display letters
     indicating the nation which owns the sector).  Numbers greater
     than 9 are displayed as a plus sign (for example, metal 12). A few
     options require further explanation:
    *[p]opulation*
          For sectors containing less than 950 people, this displays a
          number indicating the rounded number of people divided by 100.
          Thus a sector with 475 people will be displayed with a "5".
          For sectors with more than 950 people, an "I" is displayed.

    *[T]errain move cost*
          This shows the basic move cost of each sector, with regard to
          your race.

    *army [M]ove cost*
          This shows the move cost for each sector, after adjustments
          are made for the army you have selected.  For example, if your
          army flies, the move costs will be much lower.

*Highlight Options*
     These select which sectors will be highlighted in the map (they
     will be displayed in reverse-video or in a different color
     depending on your terminal).

*Other Things*
     [C]enter screen at cursor will do just that, and the [W]ater
     toggle was explained at the beginning of this section.

6.3 Movement
============

The movement commands are shown in the diagram at the beginning of this
manual.  They are quite straightforward, and only behave differently
when you reach the edge of the screen.  In this case, the screen is
shifted over.  The screen can be forcibly centered around the cursor
using the [d]isplay [C]enter screen command.

   You can also jump directly to a sector with the [p] command.  You
will be prompted for the coordinates to jump to.  You can jump back to
your capital with the [P] command.

6.4.1 Information report
------------------------

To access this report you type [r]eports followed by [i]nfo.

   This report gives complete information about your nation.  Below is a
description of most parameters printed.  Simple parameters such as
_Nation_ are left out.

_Treasury, Jewels, Metal, Food_
     Your current wealth.

_Birthrate_
     The percentage by which your population increases each thon.

_Mortality_
     The percentage of people who die in your nation every thon.

_Intelligence_
     This affects your acquisition of technological skill.  It can be
     increased by building universities.

_Magic Aptitude_
     This affects how quickly you learn the spells for your nation's
     magical order, and how many spell points you gain.  It is based on
     your race.

_Magic Skill_
     What level of magic your nation is capable of.  Investment in
     magic R&D increases this.

_Speed_
     Your armies' move rate is proportional to this.

_Spell points_
     Tells you how many you have and how many are spent for maintenance
     of spirits.

_Technology skill_
     What level of technology your nation has reached.  Investment in
     technological R&D increases this.

_Farming skill_
     The higher this is the more food you produce per farmer.  This is
     based on your race and can be increased by new technologies.

_Mining skill_
     This affects how productive your metal and jewel mines are.  This
     is based on your race, and can be increased by new technologies.

_Spy skill_
     This expresses how good your intelligence service is.

_Secrecy_
     This indicates how resistive you are to espionage by other nations.

_Combat bonus_
     This percentage is added to the number of soldiers in your armies
     to get the effective force your army fights with.

_Move points_
     This is the basic distance each army can move each thon.

   From here you can change your [P]assword or [l]eader name.  You can
[t]oggle your nation to or from CN status, which will cause the
computer to play your turns for you.  This will also let you choose if
your nation should receive update mail while it is being run by the
computer. Changing your nation to an CN is a risky move: the computer
will play a good game, but it will not honor your long-term plans.

6.4.2 Budget report
-------------------

To access this report you type [r]eports followed by [b]udget.

   The budget report gives you detailed breakdown of how you are
spending your money and your natural resources.

   Within the budget report you can adjust what percent of your money
and/or natural resources you are spending on research in technology, the
study of magic, and reconnaisance. You also can adjust your tax rate.

   The screen shows how much money you are spending on military
maintenance and other costs inccurred. The only way military
maintenance can be lowered is to disband armies. Other costs include,
but are not limited to the cost of drafting an army and the cost of
redesignating sectors.

   The metal and jewels breakdown lists the amounts spent on research
and development, from both current revenue and storage, and the amounts
spent by other activities.  Other metal expenses include the
construction of citites and the drafting of armies.  Other jewels are
used as a maintenance fee for mages.

   The commands within this screen are:

*[t]ax rate*
     Lets you adjust your tax rate.

*[T]ech R&D*
     You choose how much of your metal or money revenue is invested in
     technology research.

    *[m]etal*
          sets the amount of metal you wish to invest.

    *[M]oney*
          sets the amount of money you wish to invest.

*[M]agic R&D*
     You choose how much of your jewels or money revenue is invested in
     magic research.

    *[j]ewels*
          changes the amount of jewels you invest.

    *[M]oney*
          adjusts the amount of money you invest.


*[S]py*
     invests money in your _spy department_

*[s]torage*
     allows you to spend money/metal/jewels from your storage.  The way
     you can spend it is similar to how you spend your revenue, but it
     is a once-only expense, and is cleared after each update.

   *A note of caution*: Watch how much money you are spending
carefully; you can run your nation at a deficit, but if you have no
money, you cannot draft, construct or redesignate.  If someone attacks
you and you need armies quickly, you will be in trouble.

6.4.3 Production report
-----------------------

To access this report you type [r]eports followed by [p]roduction.

   The production report tells you how many people are employed and
unemployed in each area of your economy.  It also shows you the average
productivity of each employee.  Your total economy is listed as
_General_, and below it is broken down into _Metal miners, Jewel
Miners, Farmers_, and _Services_.  Services include all other types of
employment, such as workers in cities, forts, etc.

6.4.4 Nations report
--------------------

To access this report you type [r]eports followed by [n]ations.

   This report displays minimal information on each nation in the world.
The report lists the nation id, nation name, nation mark, leader name,
and race of each nation.  If the nation is currently being played by
the computer, "cn" is displayed along with the information.  If the
nation has been destroyed, that will also be indicated.  You are also
told the size of the world and how many nations are in it.

   Within this report is the [s]py option. If you select this, you will
be prompted for a nation id, and then you will be presented with a
screen that allows you to bribe officials in that nation for
information.

   You pay a certain amount of jewels in bribes, of which a percentage
equal to the tax rate of the nation being spied upon ends up in that
nations coffers. Certain types of information are easier to obtain than
others.  In order of increassing difficulty: [C]apital location,
[t]echnology level, [e]conomy, ma[g]ic skill, [p]opulation, and
[m]ilitary.  The accuracy of the information recieved depends on the
type of information sought, comparison of your spy skill to their
secrecy skill, and upon the amount of jewels spent as a percentage of
the nation being spied upon's jewel supply.  And with each attempt at
spying made there is a small chance that the spy will be noticed by the
other nation.

   You can also steal technology from another nation, and while the
factors involved are still the same, it is much more difficult, the spy
is much more likely to be caught, and if you don't spend enough in
bribes then it is almost certain that you'll get no results.  Lastly,
the amount of tech stolen depends also on the difference in your tech
levels.  It is much easier to steal technology from nations vastly
superior to your own than from those close to your level.

6.4.5 Diplomacy report
----------------------

To access this report you type [r]eports followed by [d]iplomacy.

   Diplomacy with other nations is extremely important.  You should set
a status with each nation you have met.  This is done in the
_diplomacy_ report.

   In most cases, all the nations in a dominion game will not fit on the
screen at once.  By pressing [>] or [.] you can move to the next page
of nations.  Pressing [<] or [,] will go back a page.  Once you have
found the nation you wish to change your status to, press [c]hange
status and enter the nation number.  You will be presented with a list
of statuses to choose from.

   Be sure to read section *Note Diplomacy report:: on diplomatic
statuses for more information on what the statuses mean, and how to
change statuses.

6.5 Construction
================

You can construct on a sector with the [C]onstruct command.  Your
construction will cost money and/or metal, and can make that sector
more valuable.  The construct menu options are:

*[r]oads*
     Roads decrease the move cost for you (and anyone else) in the
     sector.  The cost for building roads doubles for the next level of
     road construction.  For each level of roads construction, the move
     cost goes down by 1 (but it never goes below 1).

*[f]ortification*
     Fortifies the current sector: adds 10 to the fortification level,
     which gives your armies or armies of treatied nations that much
     bonus when defending that sector, and allied nations one-half that
     bonus.  Many fortifications can be built on a sector and their
     effect is cumulative.  The cost doubles for each level of
     fortification.

*[b]ubbles*
     These are air/water-tight bubbles.  They are necessary to colonize
     underwater (if you are a land race) and land (if you are an
     underwater nation).  Once you have a bubble, you can move troops
     and civillians to that sector.  Only one bubble can be constructed
     on a sector (that is all you need).

*ref[i]nery*
     A refinery is constructed in a metal mine, and will increase the
     productivity of the mine by 12% by refining the metals produced
     there.  Only one refinery can be constructed on a sector.

*[d]estroy*
     This will bring up a sub-menu that allows you to remove any of the
     above.  Removal of construction will cost you money, but you will
     also be able to retrieve a small percentage of the metal building
     costs.

   What you can construct on a sector, and how much of it you can
construct, is based on your technology level.  As your technology
improves, you will gain new skills which let you construct more.

File: dominion.info,  Node: Wizardry,  Prev: Construction,  Up: Detailed description of commands

6.6 Wizardry
============

Type [W]izardry to enter the wizardry menu.

   The wizardry command has five options.  These are:
*[l]ist spells and spirits*
     This will show you which spirits are available to summon and how
     many spell points they cost, and which spells you can cast, how
     much they cost, and how long they last (in thons).

*[c]ast a spell*
     This lists the available spells, and asks you to enter the name of
     the spell you wish to cast.  If the spell affects a sector (such
     as _caltitude_) it will affect the sector your mage is on.  If it
     affects an army (such as _hide_army_), you will be asked to enter
     the army id.  The army must be on the current sector.

*[s]ummon a spirit*
     This lists the available spirits, and asks you to enter the name
     of the desired spirit.  The spirit will appear on the current
     sector.  Spirits may only be summoned in your own land.

*[h]anging spells*
     This lists all spells you have cast which have not yet expired,
     and indicates how much longer the spell will last. For example,
     the _hide_sector_ spell lasts for eight thons, so would appear in
     the list until that time is up.  In this list you may [z]oom on a
     specific spell, which will give more detail, such as which sector
     the spell affects.  You may also [d]elete a spell which will
     terminate it early.

*[i]nitiate a mage*
     Mages are needed to cast spells or summon spirits.  They cost
     jewels to initiate and maintain, and move twice as fast as regular
     armies.

7 The update
************

It can be useful to understand exactly what happens during the update.
Here are the steps and the order in which the computer performs them.

  1. The current world is loaded. Each nation is loaded.

  2. Hanging spells are loaded

  3. Trading via cargos is handled.

  4. CN moves are made.

  5. Technology, Magic, and Spy skills are updated.

  6. Revenue of money, metal, jewels and food are calculated.

  7. Civilian migration occurs.

  8. Battles are resolved.

  9. Sector capture is handled.

 10. Diplomacy is updated (nations become "met")

 11. Armies are reset.  Mages are disbanded if maintaince jewels are
     missing.

 12. Mail is sent to each nation and statistics are posted to news.

 13. The new world file is saved.


* Menu:

* Migration::


File: dominion.info,  Node: Migration,  Up: The update

7.1 Migration
=============

Civilian migration happens automatically.  The people move according to
the laws of the country.  As a leader you can set those laws with the
[o]ptions screen:  you can set migration to be _Free_ (the default),
_Restricted_ or _None_.

_Free_
     People look for the sectors that have the most available jobs,
     because that's where they will get the best pay/best job.  Some
     attraction is also excersized by how pleasant a sector's living
     conditions are, but in general a constant ratio of employment is
     preserved locally.

_Restricted_
     The govevernment (you) has gotten sick of all these civilians
     wandering around so much.  So civilians will not be allowed to
     leave their present place of residence unless they can prove they
     are unemployed.  If so then they will move to the sectors
     surrounding them, partially by number of jobs available, partially
     by the desirability of the sectors available.  However all sectors
     in range will be put to full employement if possible.  If there is
     nowhere to go they will wander aimlessly in search of a place to
     find a job, jumping with the latest rumor of employment.

_None_
     The government has decreed that there will be no civillian
     movement.  Where they are is where they stay, and where they are
     born is where they will die.  Unless the army comes to get them in
     caravans or ships, they will stay put.

*********

Version 1.02 of Dominion was the first with this name.  It was
previously called _Stony Brook World_ (SBW), until too many people
suggested a catchier name.

   Here is a list of the people who actually wrote code for sbw/dominion
that is in the current release.  The order is that in which they wrote
their first piece of code.

   Mark Galassi (<rosalia@nis.lanl.gov>) User interface (in curses),
basic data structures, world generator, economy, technology, magic,
basic army work, manual and formatting of manual with LaTeXinfo,
miscellaneous.  Currently maintains Dominion.

   Michael Fischer (<greendog@insti.physics.sunysb.edu>) Update program,
battle code, developed exec file format, dom_print, manual, lots of
other things.

   Doug Novellano (<doug@insti.physics.sunysb.edu>) Mail and News
systems.

   Keith Messing (<keith@insti.physics.sunysb.edu???>) Initial diplomacy
system.

   Alan Saporta (<gandalf@insti.physics.sunysb.edu>) Work on some exec
routines, many suggestions of directions for the game.

   Joanne Rosenshein (<raven@max.physics.sunysb.edu>) Initial draft of
the manual, many suggestions of directions for the game.

   Stephen Bae (<sbae@insti.physics.sunysb.edu???>) Basic world memory
allocation.

   Chris Coligado (<noel@max.physics.sunysb.edu???>) Army and battle
code.

   C. Titus Brown (<brown@reed.edu>) Adding nations and improvements on
the reports; revised army menu and transportation menu.  Lots of
miscellaneous things.

   Charles Ofria (<charles@krl.caltech.edu>) Designed the "cns" file,
most magic orders and many races and techno powers; coded some spells.

   There are also some major contributions from people not in Stony
Brook:

   Stephen Underwood (<hiranu@netcom.com>) Fractal terrain generator
and contributions in very many areas.

   Paolo Montrasio (<montra@ghost.unimi.it>) Several suggestions.

   Kevin Hart (<hart@cs.utk.edu>) CN system.

   Many others have made very important creative suggestions to the
game, though they were not involved in the actual coding.  Here are some
names that come to mind.  Please send us mail if we have forgotten any.
Tony Matranga, Tim Poplaski, Chris Adami, and everyone else who
participated in the FALL SBW and SPRING DOMINION games at Stony Brook
in the fall 1990 and spring 1991 semesters.
