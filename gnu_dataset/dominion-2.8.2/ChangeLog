2005-02-02  Mark Galassi  <mark@galassi.org>

	* README, configure.ac, dominion.spec, NEWS: updates to prepare
	for a 2.8.2 release.

	* armylib.c (delete_army_nation): fixed another bug in the freeing
	of armies -- the deletion of the army at the head of the list was
	not done correctly.

2005-02-01  Mark Galassi  <mark@galassi.org>

	* *.c: followed gcc's advice and replaced all mktemp() calls with
	mkstemp() calls, and all gets() calls with fgets() calls.

	* common.h, *.c: took the #include <string.h> out of common.h and
	put it in the individual .c files.  This might help with cygwin.

2005-01-31  Mark Galassi  <mark@galassi.org>

	* NEWS, configure.ac, dominion.spec: updated for a version 2.8.1
	release.

	* *.c: lots of cleanup to make it compile cleanly (almost) with
	-Wall.

2003-06-11  Mark Galassi  <mark@galassi.org>

	* update.c, cn.c, cnlib.c: fixed some bugs to the CN merging --
	lists were not properly handled during CN army merge.

2003-06-09  Mark Galassi  <mark@galassi.org>

	* configure.ac: upped version to 2.8 -- new release!

	* Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS): set a -DPREFIX since this seems to be
	the right place to do it.

	* configure.ac: took out some definitions which are probably
	obsolete, like the version string and the info path.

	* autogen.sh: added autoheader invocation.

	* autogen.sh: new file for developers to bootstrap the
	configure/build process.

	* makeworld.c, printmap.c: added a POSIX include.

	* file.c: updated to use gzip instead of compress.  Some day I
	should use zlib.

	* addnation.c (setup_armies): modification to the combat bonus so
	that relatively more weight is given to intelligence.

2003-06-03  Mark Galassi  <mark@galassi.org>

	* dominion.spec: new file, an RPM spec file for dominion.

	* configure.ac: upped the version to 2.7.1 for this bugfix.

	* update.c: added a mailfile = NULL after fclose(mailfile) to make
	it more robust against double-closing.

	* README, MACHINES, AUTHORS: minor updates, still very obsolete.

	* configure.in: deleted.

	* configure.ac: renamed from configure.in, and made to work with
	newer versions of automake/autoconf.  Upped the version to 2.7.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added the manual page, and did a few
	things to make it work with modern versions of automake.

1997-06-14  Prydain <prydain>

	* mag_*: rebalancing of magic orders.

	* army_types: improved bonus on crossbowmen to reflect higher tech
	level.

	* races: rebalancing of races.

	* spirit_types: rebalancing of spirit types.

1997-05-22  Prydain <prydain>

	* maglib.c: revision of magical formulae.

	* techno.c: revision of formulae.

	* armylib.c: fixed some bugs to make armies
	patrol/intercept/garrison only if they are not in transport.

	* cn.c, cn.h, cnlib.c: updates to the CN code.

	* cns, cns.small: rebalancing of the CNs.

1997-05-22  Bernie <bernie>

	* battle.c: updates to the intercept code.

	* menus.c, proto.h, spells.c: small changes to window sizes and
	hanging spell display

	* nation.c: set the combat_bonus.

1997-05-15  Prydain <prydain>

	* army_types: Balanced the Race and Magic orders, Aded troop type
	Skeletons for Necromancy which lost them as a a spirit, Still need
	to do mods to help files Unity and Insect should be more balanced
	now with the rest of the orders and several such as Diana and Aule
	were brought up to par with the others.

Tue Jan  7 07:40:43 1997  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@papageno.lanl.gov>

	* dominion.texi: converted manual to texinfo.

Sat Dec 28 20:07:00 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@papageno.lanl.gov>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): added $(DATA), since the new automake
	does not automatically distribute DATA variables.

	* configure.in (curses): added a check for ncurses, so things will
	work with red hat linux 4.0.
	(VERSION): upped to 2.6, in case 2.5 has already been used.
	Preparing for a release.

	* Created a CVS repository on the GNU computers.

Tue May  7 14:35:39 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@edipus>

	* Fixed the INFO_DIR and INFO_INTRO variables: they are now
	figured out by configure.in.  VERSION is also set in configure.in
	now.

Fri May  3 15:51:26 1996  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@edipus>

	* In March I converted dominion to autoconf.  Now I have just
	converted it to automake; looks good so far, but I'm trying to
	figure out how to do the texinfo stuff.  I'm cutting version 2.2.

Fri Feb 17 10:11:31 1995  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@unive.physics.sunysb.edu>

	* Found and fixed a bug in makeworld.c that only manifested itself
	on the alpha (thanks to Titus for allowing me some alpha time).
	In interpolate(), the Y[] array was not being initialized in some
	cases.  I added an initialization to zero.  Note that this is (I
	believe) the first bug I have found in Stephen Underwood's code.

Sun Feb 12 20:33:47 1995  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@unive.physics.sunysb.edu>

	* Great ease-of-compilation improvement: I have now defined BSD or
	SYSV automatically for several architectures.  It should be
	possible to run "make all" on most architectures now.

	* Went and put string.h/strings.h in config.h, now properly set
	according to the BSD/SYSV definition.

	* Updated MACHINES file to account for linux and to be more
	accurate on all the other architectures.

Tue Dec  6 22:47:27 1994  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@unive.physics.sunysb.edu>

	* Added a MACHINES file that describes the architectures upon
	which Dominion has been tested.

Sat Nov 26 13:44:13 1994  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@rsity.physics.sunysb.edu>

	* Added a make depend: rule, and ran "makedepend -Y *.c" manually
	so that the distribution has good dependencies.

Thu Nov 24 12:01:16 1994  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@unive.physics.sunysb.edu>

	* Carried out a complete conversion to ANSI C, since that is now
	the most widely available form of C.  This involved prototyping
	most functions and doing the correct anal retentive things to make
	gcc -Wall compile it without any complaints.  In the course of
	this a few very minor bugs were discovered.

Tue Sep  6 13:10:09 1994  Mark Galassi  (rosalia@insti.physics.sunysb.edu)

	* Fixed the NOBEEP definition default to match what the comment
	says.

Fri Jun 11 18:14:30 1993  Mark Galassi  (rosalia@max)

	* Kevin's new features warrant a new version number: 1.08beta.
	Note that we never got our act together to put out 1.07, so there
	is a gap between 1.07beta and 1.08beta.

	* (almost all files): after Kevin's CN revamp I massively replaced
	"npc" with "cn" in the source files.  We now have Computer Nations
	(CNs) instead of Non Player Countries (NPCs).

	* dominion.h, config.h, common.h, cur_stuff.h Makefile: introduced
	a new file common.h which defines some things (like CTL() and
	beep()) which must really be defined before a lot of the other .h
	files are parsed.  So common.h is now included in dominion.h
	pretty early (but after config.h, so it knows which OS we have),
	and includes some stuff that used to be in cur_stuff.h and other
	.h files.

Fri Jun 11 09:52:04 1993  Kevin Hart  (hart@max)

	* New computer nations have been added.    Lots of
	player-changeable parameters have been added.

	* cn.c: Replaces npc.c

	* cnlib.c: Replaces npclib.c

	* cn.h: Contains the structure for the computer nation parameters

	* cn_params.c: Routines for loading, saving, modifying parameters

	* Makefile: Above files put in appropriate places.

	* dominion.h: nation file structure changed for cns

	* nation.c: referrences to npc_agg, etc removed.

	* file.c:  referrences to npc_agg, etc. replaced by *comp_params

	* makeworld.c: referrences to npc_agg, etc. removed from
	Gamemaster creation.

	* addnation.c: initialization of CN nations changed.

	* reports.c: [c]hange params option added to info screen.

Fri Dec 18 11:44:22 1992  Michael D. Fischer  (greendog@insti)

	* world.c: Fixed bug causing patrols/intercepts to affect treatied
	nations.

Mon Dec 14 11:05:34 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee@insti)

	* economy.c: add get_max_employed to centralize the employment
		    determination functions.  Should fix zoom display bug.

        * commands.c, update.c: use get_max_employed

Sun Dec  6 16:23:36 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee@insti)

	* army.c: Add confirmation for drafting large numbers
		  of wizards/sorcerer's/caravans/machines/ships etc.
		
        * transport.c: Make sure you can't transfer non-flying army
		       onto flying army.

        * battle.c: Fix problem where small armies are left after large
		    battles.  Set up a battle ratio that defines when
		    the battle is ugly enouhg to be a complete victory
		    depending on sector designation, whether you are defending
		    home turf, and altitutde of sector.

Sun Nov 22 16:41:23 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia@max)

	* Fixed a really bad bug with the available armies code: the
	user.n_availa_armies variable was being used, really, to determine
	the total number of available armies, and this got screwed up in
	the update code when NPCs were being run.  The result was that a
	wolf spirit type was interpreted as an army type because the
	n_avail_armies varbiable went over beyond the army_types[] array
	and into the spirit_types[] array, so it also considered a "wolf"
	to be an army!!  This only happened with "wolf" because the
	spirit_types[] array elements are a different size, so only in the
	first one would the names match.  It was really weird to track
	down!!

	* Fixed bug which caused core dump when viewing armies if the last
	army was on a end of a view-screen.

Wed Nov 18 11:12:54 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia@max)

	* Fixed some routines in news.c where fopen() could return NULL
	and work still be done on the file pointer.

Fri Nov  6 17:22:48 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia@max)

	* spells.c: now if a caltitude spell would bring you to SEA_LEVEL
	it will continue and take you one step further.  This is because
	SEA_LEVEL does (or should) not really exist in the map.

Wed Oct 21 13:39:58 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* transport.c: now towns are equivalent to cities and capitals as
	far as trade is concerned.  it used to be you could not load stuff
	in them...

Wed Oct 14 18:56:42 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* mail.c, int_mail.c, reports.c: added while() loops to make sure
	that the various wait() calls finally returned with the correct
	value.  This was important to fix problems when editors and
	mailers were forked off.  (this was actually done a few days ago)

	* file.c, diplolib.c, misc.c, addnation.c, makeworld.c,
	dominion.h: fixed these files so that now world.nations[] si a
	dynamic array allocated when the world is read in, and it does not
	have a hard-coded size.

Wed Oct 14 16:50:28 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at insti)

	* int_mail.c: remove uneeded temp file from mail_reader()

	* costs.h, file.c: Add BATTLE_INTENSITY parameter.

	* battle.c: modify calc_casualty algorithm  Make it work. 
                    as well, add a GEOGRAPHY_BONUS to make terrain
                    factor into combat.

Thu Oct  1 14:49:14 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at insti)

	* config.h, makeworld.c Added support for Sun 2 system.

Tue Sep 22 11:20:47 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* Fixed trade code to accept cities and capitals as trading places
	too: not just towns.

	* Revamped the haste_army spell; its effect is much steadier now:
	it always adds the army's standard rate to the current rate, which
	doubles the speed in some cases, but avoids the problem of
	recursive doubling.

Thu Sep 17 19:04:57 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* Fixed the problem in which a person can fly a ship and any army
	on that ship will fly too.  Now you cannot load non-flying armies
	onto a ship, and you cannot cast FLY on a ship that has a
	non-flying army loaded.  (By "ship" I also mean caravan.)  There
	is some ugly "dangling else" code in the checks for
	loading/unloading caravans and all.  I cleaned it for loading
	armies, but it should be done for the rest.

Tue Sep  8 01:01:53 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at insti)

	* diplolib.c:Exit if you can't read the initial diplofile.

	* update.c:Fix timing on diplofile read.

	* dominion.tex:Fix comment that tech gains from money
                       research depend on sqrt of metal spent

	* dominion.c:fix beroot to be run if #ifdef ANDREW

Sun Aug 30 22:06:43 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* Reorganized Makefile and dominion.h.  Updated README file.

	* Fixed bug causing crash when nation destroyed.

Wed Aug 26 18:17:51 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at insti)

	* commands.c: Fix warning and remove old techmails.

Tue Aug 25 17:31:45 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at insti)

	* army.c: Ad enemy armies to the army sector zoom. 
                  Also dealt with disguese in case it ever implements.

	* movement.c: Make sure allies arnt' stopped
 
	* file.c added fix for large number in geo multiplication

	* config.h, cinfo.c: Added support for the NOBEEP option.

Tue Aug 11 11:32:55 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* battle.c: fixed bug causing random casualties of uncontrolled
	armies.

Mon Jul 27 19:46:27 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* update.c: Fixed some bugs with diplomacy including sector taking
	and proper stop flags.  Also fixed employement as it relates
	to movement and refineries.

Sun Jul 19 14:11:28 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at insti)

	* battle.c: fixed bug in is_war() function which caused battles
		    on sectors with uncontrolled spirits.

Sat Jul 18 23:41:45 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at insti)

	* Makefile, config.h: Moved most configuration information out
		    of the Makefile and into config.h.

Fri Jul 17 18:12:01 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at insti)

	* update.c, etc: Improved output of update program and added
		    functionality for multiple debug levels.

Wed Jul 15 21:27:00 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at insti)

	* battle.c: fixed bug causing mages to die in battle

Tue Jul 14 11:04:06 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at insti)

	* misc.c: fixed bug in subtsect.c where it checks to see
                  if the sector is owned by another nation.

	* update.c: added subtsect error checking and modified
	            reset_armies to check for titles to unowned land.

Wed Jul  8 19:50:25 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* Makefile, file.c: Changed -DHOSTNAME to gethostname() call

Tue Jul  7 15:59:56 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* spy.c: You can't spy on unmet nations.

	* mail.c: remove mail file in mail_send consistantly.

Sun Jul  5 12:09:43 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* update.c: added a lot of consistency checks to make sure that
	transported armies are not orphaned when their caravans (or ships
	or whatever) die, and other similar problems.

	* transport.c and army.c: introduced feature forbidding trading of
	race-specific armies.

Sat Jul  4 20:44:54 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* makeworld.c, Makefile: Add support for att 3b2's

Fri Jul  3 11:32:46 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* update.c: fix problem reading cargos & expand civilian 
  	    movement range to 4 sector radius for consideration.

	* file.c: fixed small bugs in declarations

	* misc.h, misc.c, commands.c, cur_stuff.c,movement.c:
	    Have stopped and impenetrable sectors properly
            displayed, and have the numbering of displays be
            0-f in hex rather than 0-9 so that more accurate
            data can be had.

Thu Jun 25 10:06:34 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* battle.c: Fixed bug that caused kamikaze armies to not die

	* user.c: Gamemaster password now works to log into any nation.

	* spells.c: Armies in "occupy" mode are set back to defend when
	"castled" to prevent occupying your own sectors, etc.

Wed Jun 24 18:57:13 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* economy.c, commands.c: Fix bug in Zoom Sector

Wed Jun 24 16:44:53 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* spells.c:  Fixed bug in "castle" spell for chess.  The spell
	point cost was ADDED to the nation instead of subtracted.

	* army.c, armylib.c:  Fixed bug in [d]rafting of mages.  Nations
	were not being charged the jewel cost for the draft!

Sun Jun 21 01:09:14 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* file.c: fix byte-independtant write_army routine.

Fri Jun 19 19:35:44 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* spy.c: added transfer of % of spying costs to 
                 the nations spied upon.

Thu Jun 18 17:13:35 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* addnation.c: Default forts should be 10 not 1

	* spy.c: Add tech theft, and spy capture

Wed Jun 17 12:29:52 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* root.c, commands.c, Makefile: fix bug in ctech_skill.  Before if
	you had a raise in your tech skill it wouldn't modify any national
	attributes.  

	* techno.c: Fix small bug in get_tech_entry

	* costs.h: Fixed sacrificed fraction for sacrirfice spell

	* spirit_types, mag_*: multiplied spell/spirit costs by *.

	* menus.c: expanded width of spell and spirit window.

Fri Jun 12 00:54:02 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* various files: armies must stop in forts and cities
             and capitals with at least 50 people in them.

        * reports.c: display max roads and forts.

        * economy.c, costs.h, ext.c: make refineries modify only # of
	employees at mines

Thu Jun 11 17:18:20 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* nation.c, budget.c, economy.c: Removed charity

Sat Jun  6 01:07:35 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* spells.c: modify the water walk spell so it didn't cause armies
	to sufficate, and worked for below water creatures

        * update.c, battle.c, nation.c, user.c spelllib.c: finally fix the
	bug so that spell deleteion and army removal works properly.  As
	well the is_spelled routine finally does things right.

	* Makefile: make it work with max, and make dom_print compile

Fri May 29 16:02:35 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* update.c: Took out options for backing up LIBDIR before
	and after an update.  This should be done in a different
	way.  All capital sackings should be reported in a single
	"Sacked Capitals" news post instead of a separate post for
	each sacked capital.

	* battle.c: New army bonus calculation.  No longer posts a
	news article "Battles from thon X to thon Y" if there were
	no battles. All-new battle code implemented.

	* many files: Changed old system of separate nation attack
	and defense bonuses to new combined "combat" bonus.

Wed May 27 16:19:31 1992  Stephen H. Underwood  (heechee at max)

	* so many files I can't remember them all:

           1) The file save format has been vastly modified, and is now
	   byte-order independant, so you can read and write to the world
	   files from  any number of different machine types sharing a
	   net.  As well we can handle bug reports in terms of tarfiles. 

           2) Constructions are now technologically dependant.  You start
	   with the ability to make one road and 10 fort levels, and this
	   raises from time to time at appropriate places in the
	   technology file. As well bubbles and refinaries are not
	   availble until you reach the technological level appropriate
	   for them. (see below)  This idea was discussed at length a few
	   monts ago, and I'm finally writing it now.

           3) Refinaries no longer take up an entire sector, and can be
	   built in the same sector as the mine, so that when you have the
	   tech, you can build refinaries on your mines to increase
	   production. (They are implemented as a sector flag.)  This idea
	   was also dealt with a few months ago, and I'm just getting
	   around to it.  

           4) Mountain peaks are much harder to travel on, and people will
	   not travel to them voluntarily.  They are supposed to resembel
	   the top altitudes, which are not very livable or useful.

Tue May 26 13:03:30 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* dominion.tex: Total overhaul of manual.  Should be pretty
	accurate and consistent now. Still needs some reorganization.

	* commands.c: added min and max employment to [Z]oom window.

Fri Apr 24 12:48:28 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* dominion.h: changed some parameters in Ssector from "int"
	to "short int" to save space.  World file generally now 25%
	smaller.

Tue Mar 31 12:29:29 1992  Michael D Fischer  (greendog at max)

	* world.c, misc.c menu.c: implemented <d>isplay <P>atrolled or
	<I>ntercepted sectors.

Mon Mar 30 11:29:07 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* mail files: fixed problem with lines starting with a "From", and
	made it so mail is in order sent, instead of inverse order sent.

	* transport.c: removed the '*' unloading options which causes a
	lot of probelms.

	* several files: added a race-specific army flag /R which is not
	yet used, but is there and ready.

Thu Mar 12 12:56:48 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at max)

	* battle.c: now reports the army bonus in each battle.

	* root.c, nation.c, reports.c: implemented the [npc+mail] flag
	properly (it used to not work when you set it).

	* budget.c: fixed serious problem where if you had negative
	predictions of jewels or metal or money you could not do
	*anything*, even if it would improve on those predictions.

	* army_types: lowered costs for Legion so they are now a better
	infantry (put it in manual), and lowered Harpy army move rate for
	balance.

	* commands.c: fixed a bug in trial redesignation to capital, which
	should make the whole redesignation process much more solid.

Sat Mar  7 22:20:32 1992  Mark Galassi  (rosalia at dirac)

	* dominion.tex: added sections on terrain, altitude and climate.

	* many files: implemented a bunch of changes from people on the
	net.  They fix a lot of problems in version 1.06.  One of the most
	fundamental caused all spells to be cast multiple times during the
	update, which can cause all sorts of problems with terraforming
	spells.  Also made it so that wget_name() enforces the NAMELEN

	* maglib.c When doing the magic, we make sure that we don't
