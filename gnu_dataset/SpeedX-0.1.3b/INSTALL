* To compile SpeedX, just run the ./configure script
and do a make after. The binary will be in the src 
directory, run the game from this directory.

* To install SpeedX copy the src directory to 
/usr/local/games/SpeedX for example and 
create a script file in /usr/local/bin like this :

#!/bin/sh
cd /usr/local/games/SpeedX
speedx $@
