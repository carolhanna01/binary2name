\\ OVERVIEW :

SpeedX is a clone of good old racing game in rear view. The
goal of this GNU project is to propose a quick and multiplayer
game under X11.  The code has to be the more portable as
possible. This project can be freely modified and copied
under the terms of the GNU Public License.

Everybody who want to help in improving the code (See TODO),
as well as graphisms, musics or sounds are welcome. This
project have the purpose to demonstrate the capacity of X11
in gaming. You could learn how to handle X11 graphics
functions by reading the source. You could navigate the source
with emacs :
	Do a 'etags *.c *.h' in the src directory
	In emacs do a `M-.' on a variable or a function
	 and emacs will find the definition of it
	Do a `M-*' to get back.

Do not hesitate to give me feedbacks and suggestions.

\\ USAGE :

To move :

					8
				4   		6 (On the Numeric Keypad)
				  	2


The screen :
The first  line is the speed.
The second is your position.
The third shows the oppponents position. 

If you have a fast computer and you are annoyed with the
100% CPU, you could change the WAIT constant in const.h from
0 to 20000 for example. This lets the game waiting a little
time. (do a `make' after)

(nb : do not forget to killall speedx
before playing again if you have a 
"bad request error" because we use
shared memory and 2 processus)

To play with another player on the same screen :
				speedx -2

The second player plays with (AZERTY keyboard ..)

					e
				s		f
					c
	
Musics are stored in the ./music directory. This can be
.mod, .xm or other format supported by libmikmod. If you
have racing music to propose, just send me a link.

Difficulty level :

				./speedx -l 0
				..
				./speedx -l 3
