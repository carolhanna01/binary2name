About the GnuDOS library
=========================

GnuDOS package is a GNU software. It is a library designed to help new users
of the GNU system, who are coming from a DOS background, fit into the picture
and start using the GNU system with ease. It also addresses the console
programmers of such programs that have the look and feel of old DOS system.
The library is composed of core utilities and software applications:

* The core library (corelib) contains five utilities: Kbd (for keyboard 
handling), UKbd (includes unicode support), Screen (for screen drawing), 
Dialogs (for dialog boxes/window drawing), and Strings (for strings functions).

* The software applications are three: Prime (console file manager), Mino
(console text editor), and Fog (console form designer).


The rationale behind the GnuDOS corelib library
================================================

So, you like programming under the GNU/Linux console, right?. And you came
from the DOS land where every thing was white/blue or yellow/black. You 
want to make users coming from DOS land feel home when switching to the
powerful GNU system. Okay, That's good. But there are some catches when 
programming under the console. First of all, you can't format your output 
exactly the way you want in terms of color, positioning, and so on. You can 
go deep and use terminal escape sequences (as most GNU/Linux consoles emulate
the VT100 terminal), but who can remember these?.

Next comes the problem of the terminal driver interfering with the keyboard 
input. You don't get the real key scancodes sent by the keyboard. The driver 
gets in the way and performs a lot of steps to map the right key to the right 
keycode, process some special key combinations (like CTRL+ALT+DEL) and so on, 
before passing the result to the terminal. And in the case of XTerminal, the X
terminal does more processing before sending the final result to your program. 
You say what difference does it make? you are taking all the pain off my head,
why should I bother? Here is why:

If you want your program to be REALLY interactive, like waiting the user to 
press a key (press, not press and release and press ENTER!) you can't rely on 
the good old getc() or getchar() functions, as they will return an input char 
alright, but only after the user presses ENTER!. That's no good for us, you 
know.
Another thing is reading special keys, like SHIFT, ALT and CTRL. You don't get
scancodes for these keys (not all times, at least).

So how to make your program get over these problems? well, you can implement 
your own keyboard driver, which will be very painful to  construct your keymap 
tables and do all the calculations, or your can interfere with the input sent 
from the console driver before it does any further processing on it. The GnuDOS 
Kbd utility does this. It tells the console driver to send it raw data (with no 
processing), and it then looks into its own table to see what key (or key 
combinations) does this scancode means, and then gives you the result.

Right now, the Kbd utility doesn't recognize ALL the possible keys that can be
entered through a keyboard. It recognizes all the alphanumeric charset, the 
TAB, CAPS, ENTER, SPACE, CTRL, ALT, SHIFT, DEL, INS, HOME, ESC, and END. More 
keys (like function keys F1-F12) will be added with future releases.

The other thing the GnuDOS library provides is a utility for controlling the 
Screen. It provides functions for getting the screen size (height and width), 
setting the screen colors, and clearing the screen.

The third utility is the Dialogs utility, which (as its name says) provides a 
ready to use class of dialog boxes under the console. It provides two types of
boxes: simple dialog box (to provide the user with a messeage, or asking for 
confirmation, ...) and an input box (to ask the user to enter some input).

This is a sample program hello_gnudos that demonstrates how to use the various
elements and utilities of the GnuDOS corelib library.

#include "console/dialogs.h"
#include "console/screen.h"
#include "console/kbd.h"

void sighandler(int signo)
{
    //do what ever needs to be done here. 
    //The following line is just an example.
    fprintf(stderr, "SIGNAL %d received\n", signo);
}


int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
 if(!initTerminal()) 
 {
   fprintf(stderr, "Error initializing keyboard. Aborting.\n");
   exit(1);
 }
 
 //clear the screen
 clearScreen();
 
 //set screen colors
 setScreenColors(FG_COLOR[COLOR_WINDOW], BG_COLOR[COLOR_WINDOW]);
 
 //Get screen size, then draw a box with given coordinates, 
 //title, and set clearing of box area
 getScreenSize();
    
  msgBox("This was an example", OK, INFO);
  drawBox(2, 2, SCREEN_H-2, SCREEN_W-2, " Example ", YES);
  locate(3, 3); printf("Hello GnuDOS!");
  locate(4, 3); printf("This is an example Window.");
  locate(5, 3); printf("Press ENTER to exit...");
  while(1) 
  {
    if(getKey() == ENTER_KEY) break;
  }
  
 //very important to restore keyboard state to its
 //previous state before exiting
 restoreTerminal();
 exit(0);
}//end main


Remember two things:
(1) a call to initTerminal() must be invoked before using the library
(2) a call to restoreTerminal() must be done before exiting the program

If you forget point (2), you will leave the user's terminal in raw mode, which
(under console) means he/she will not be able to do virtually anything (not 
even switching terminal by CTRL+ALT+F key!). The only way out is a reboot!. 
Under X it is less worse, usually the user will need to close the xterm or 
kill the process. Still though, it is IMPERATIVE to call restoreTerminal() 
before exiting your program!. To make sure no funny things happen (like your 
progrm crashing for whatever reason, or your admin killing it, to name a few) 
before you call restoreTerminal(), you better use the catchSignals() function 
of the Dialogs utility. Remember though that there are some signals 
that can't be caught by your program, like the SIGSTOP and SIGKILL signals. 
This is why we used the catchSignals() function instead of the 
catchAllSignals() function.

Also note that including the header file "dialogs.h" automatically includes 
both "screen.h" and "kbd.h" as the dialogs utility uses both of the other two.

To run programs that rely on the GnuDOS library, only the library runtime 
files are needed. On the other hand, to compile new programs that need the 
library, you will need the header files.
After installing proper packages, you should link your program against the 
GnuDOS library:
gcc -o myprog mysource.c -lgnudos

More information on the library utilities can be found by running 'info gnudos'
or 'man gnudos'.
