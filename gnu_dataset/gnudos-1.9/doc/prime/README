What is Prime?
==============
Prime is a GNU software, part of the GnuDOS package.
Prime is a file manager which works under the GNU/Linux console. It was 
influenced by other file managers (like the well known XTree Gold which was 
popular under MS-DOS). It provides a user friendly interface with menus, 
shortcuts, and key navigation. It is distributed as part of the GnuDOS
package which was developed to help users coming from DOS-like environments
feel ease when dealing with the GNU system.
Prime provides multi-level experience, the level of complexity can be adjusted
by the user: you want to use DOS-keys with a few basic GNU ones? you want to 
go with the full power of the GNU system? All are options that are provided by
the six levels of experience of Prime:

  1- Newbie: All DOS shortcut keys, no GNU keys yet
  2- Novice: DOS shortcut keys, some of which are replaced with GNU's
  3- Intermediate: DOS keys with a few more replaced with GNU keys
  4- ِAdvanced: ... And more GNU keys in
  5- ِExpert: Very few DOS keys, most are GNU keys
  6- ِVeteran: Only GNU keys, no DOS-like keys
  
You start with level 1 by default.
To set your level, call the mino with '--level X' or '-l X' options,
Where X is the level desired, for example:

$ prime --level 2

Which keys are defined for which level?
=======================================
Below is a table showing the DOS-like key combinations along with their 
respective GNU key bindings. To the right is the level at which a certain
key is defined. Each key defined is recognized in higher levels (e.g. level 2
keys are recognized in levels 3-4-5-6). Note that in level 6 only GNU keys are
defined, no DOS keys will work at this level!.

Keybindings:
============
In the table below, C-something means pressing down CTRL and then pressing the
other key. Note that '^' is the same as 'C', meaning CTRL key, it is just
typed like this so DOS users can feel familiar with the text.
The same as M-something, which means META or ALT.

Why should I use it?
====================
If you like using the console (like most GNU/Linux vintage users do), and
you came from DOS land, having a nice and easy way to run through your 
directory trees and moving files around will be an important asset in your
toolset, plus you will easily dive into the GNU system key bindings.

What do I need?
===============
The program can be invoked from the linux console or under X11 from an xterm.

How to use it?
==============
Simply invoke the 'prime' executable from the shell.
The main window has three parts:
(1) Directory view (left side): you can navigate the directory tree
(2) File view (right side): navigate/select files in the current dir
(3) Bottom view: shows the current working directory and number of selected items

Keys:
=====
Space bar: toggle selection. Selected items are marked "*"
CTRL+X:Cut selection (if no selection, cut current item). Cut items marked "^"
CTRL+C:Copy selection (if no selection, copy current item). Copy items marked "C"
CTRL+V:Paste cut/copy items in the current directory
CTRL+O:Open location
CTRL+P:Print current directory tree
CTRL+Q:Exit program
CTRL+F:Find a file
ALT+F: Open File menu
ALT+E: Open Edit menu
ALT+H: Open Help menu

What else?
==========
The program sends log information by default to a file named 'prime.log' in 
the user's home directory.
If you wish log information to be sent to another file, invoke the program 
with the file name on the command line, e.g.
$ prime --log log-file-name
or
$ prime -g log-file-name

If you don't want log information, invoke Prime as
$ prime --no-log

You can export directory tree of a given directory to a given file without 
starting Prime by typing:
$ prime -e|--export dirname filename
Note you will only type '-e' or '--export', not both.

Prime starts automatically with the directory tree of the current working 
directory. To change that, type
$ prime -d|--dir dirname

And Prime will load the directory tree of 'dirname' and start. If it fails 
(e.g. the directory does not exist), Prime will start with the current working
directory tree as usual.
