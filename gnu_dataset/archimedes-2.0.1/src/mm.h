   Archimedes is a simulator for Submicron 2D Silicon/GaAs
   Devices. It implements both the Monte Carlo method and Hybrid MEP model
   for the simulation of the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for both
   electrons and holes. It also includes the quantum effects by means 
   of effective potential method.
