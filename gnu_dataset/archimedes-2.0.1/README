I am pleased to announce the version 2.0.0 release of Archimedes.

Even if the author has worked hardly and accurately on this project, surely, some bugs are still present.

The GNU implementation of this advanced program is brought to you by
the efforts of Jean Michel D. Sellier.

The basic algorithms implemented in this simulator are described in the documentation of GNU Archimedes.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:
    jeanmichel.sellier@gmail.com
    jsellier@purdue.edu

GNU archimedes is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
