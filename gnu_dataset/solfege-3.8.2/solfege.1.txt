FILES
   /etc/solfege   if solfege is installed into /usr, or {prefix}/etc/solfege
                  in all other cases.
                  System administrators can override the values in the
                  default.config file. The most obvious values you might
                  want to change is the sound setup.
   ~/.solfegerc   This file is used to store most configuration values. While it
          is possible to edit the file by hand, everything you need can
          and should be done from the gui.
   ~/.solfege     Statistics is stored in subdirectories below this dir.

NOTES
   If you don't have /dev/music it is possible that your kernel supports
   it. Try to create the device file yourself (as root):

          # cd /dev
          # mknod music u 14 8
