Description: Ear training program for GNOME2
 GNU Solfege is an ear training program for X Window written in python,
 using the GTK+ 2.0 and GNOME2 libraries. You can practice harmonic and
 melodic intervals, chords, scales and rhythms, and you can add new
 exercises using a simple plain text file format.
 .
 Ear training is a big subject with many connections to music theory
 and performance of music, so I won't even try to make "a complete
 computer-based ear training course". But I hope someone find this
 software useful.
