# The question below is a chord, as sung by a 4 voice mixed choir.
# Think of the music as "sopran|alt|tenor|bass",
# so the voices in the choir sing tones like this:
#
#   sopran:   c''
#   alt:      e'
#   tenor:    g
#   bass:     c

question { music = "c''|e'|g|c" }

# The chord below is for a 8 voice choir. Here each voice is divided in
# two.
#
#   1. sopran:   e''
#   2. sopran:   c''
#   1. alt:      bes'
#   2. alt:      g'
#   1. tenor:    e'
#   2. tenor:    c'
#   1. bass:     g
#   2. bass      c
question { music = "e'' c''|bes' g'|e' c'|g c" }

# Of course you can write chords where only some of the voices are
# divided:
question { music = "e'' c''|g' e'|c'|g c" }

# The sing-chord exercise is currently limited to think of 4 voice mixed
# choir. So it is not possible to write chords that don't have tones in
# all 4 voice groups (SATB). Trying to write 3 voices (SAB) will fail:
# question { music = "g'|e'|c" }
