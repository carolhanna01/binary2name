<para>This page is a generic help page for all exercises written using the
<literal>chord</literal> exercise module. These exercises can ask the user for
three things: chord type, inversion and top tone. The idea is that you answer
this in three steps:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Identify the chord type.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>What is the inversion?</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Which tone is the highest tone in the chord?</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

It is important that you take your time, maybe sing the chord, and identify the chord type before you try to find the inversion.
</para>

<para>Please notice that is is also possible that an exercise will only
ask for the chord type and inversion, or even only inversion and top tone.</para>
