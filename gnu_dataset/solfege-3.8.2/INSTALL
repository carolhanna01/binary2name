1 INSTALL - how to compile and install GNU Solfege 3.8.2 on a GNU like system
*****************************************************************************

This file contains info on how to build and install GNU Solfege.  For
run-time info, check the README file and the man page.

   The homepage for GNU Solfege, `http://www.solfege.org', might also
be of interest.

1.1 Download
============

1.1.1 Source code
-----------------

The latest version is available from
`http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1465'.

   The source code is also available from the GNU ftp sites and their
mirrors: `ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/solfege' and
`ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/solfege'.

1.1.2 Precompiled binaries
--------------------------

Precompiled binaries are made available for some releases. I build the
windows installer, a liunx distribution neutral autopackage for i386
computers and the debian package myself. But I am depending on users to
provide binaries for other operating systems. The debian package is
available directly from `http://www.debian.org'.  The rest are
available from Sourceforge:
`http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1465'.

1.2 Requirements
================

The requirements are listed in the `README' file.

1.3 Configuring and compiling
=============================

     ./configure
     make
     su -c "make install"

   should work, and will install into

       /usr/local/bin
       /usr/local/share
       /usr/local/lib
       /usr/local/etc/solfege

   On FreeBSD you can use gmake:

     ./configure
     gmake
     su -c "gmake install"

   Use the `--prefix' and `--sysconfdir' command line options to
install elsewhere. For example to install in your home directory:

     ./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr --sysconfdir=$HOME/etc
     make
     make install

   If you just want to run Solfege without installing, do this:
     ./configure
     make
     ./solfege.py

   The `configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. Some of them are described below.  For a
complete list, type:

     ./configure --help

1.3.1 `--disable-pygtk-test'
----------------------------

Do not test for PyGTK, assume it is installed. Use this option if you
know the package is installed, but the configure script still cannot
detect it.

1.3.2 `--disable-oss-sound'
---------------------------

Use this if you are compiling on an OS that don't have the OSS.  The
default is `--enable-oss-sound'.

1.4 Packaging
=============

1.4.1 Debian
------------

Rename `debian-dir' to `debian' and run:

     dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc

1.4.2 Rpm-based distributions
-----------------------------

I did collection some spec files for rpm-based distros, contributed by
users. But these have not been updated for a very long time, so I do not
think they will work any more. Also, I do not test these spec files
myself, so you should send me an update if some of the Requires or
BuildRequires fields are wrong. Please notice that there may be a
difference between version 9 and 9.1 of a distro. Give me the exact
version number!

   Here is an example how to build a binary rpm package for Red Hat 9.
Replace the filenames to fit your distro if required.

     cp solfege-3.8.2.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/
     tar zxf solfege-3.8.2.tar.gz
     rpm -bb solfege-3.8.2/solfege.redhat9.spec
     rpm -i /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/solfege-3.8.2

   Hopefully, binary rpm packages for some distributions will be
provided later.
