SENDMAIL ISSUES

Many newer versions of Sendmail come with a restricted execution
utility called "smrsh", which limits the executables that sendmail can
use as mail filter programs.  You need to explicitly allow Mailman's
wrapper program to be used with smrsh before it will work.  If mail is
not getting delivered to Mailman's wrapper program and you're getting
an "operating system error" in your mail syslog, this could be your
problem.

One good way of doing this is to:

    - cd into /etc/smrsh (or where ever it happens to reside on your
      system, such as /var/smrsh or /usr/local/smrsh).

    - create a symbolic link to Mailman's wrapper program

For example, if you've installed Mailman in the standard location, you
can just execute these commands (you might have to do these as root):

    % cd /etc/smrsh
    % ln -s /home/mailman/mail/wrapper wrapper

One complication: if you're running Majordomo and Mailman
simultaneously (i.e. in the process of migrating from MD to MM :),
then you might have a small problem because Majordomo also uses a
program called `wrapper'.  In this case, Paul Tomblin suggests calling
the Mailman symlink `mailman_wrapper', and changing the alias entries
to call this instead of `wrapper'.  You might want to hack bin/newlist
to output this instead.
