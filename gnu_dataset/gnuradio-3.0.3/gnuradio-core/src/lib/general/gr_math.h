 * \brief Fast arc tangent using table lookup and linear interpolation

 * \param y component of input vector
 * \param x component of input vector
 * \returns float angle angle of vector (x, y) in radians
 *
 * This function calculates the angle of the vector (x,y) based on a
 * table lookup and linear interpolation. The table uses a 256 point
 * table covering -45 to +45 degrees and uses symetry to determine the
 * final angle value in the range of -180 to 180 degrees. Note that
 * this function uses the small angle approximation for values close
 * to zero. This routine calculates the arc tangent with an average
 * error of +/- 0.045 degrees.
