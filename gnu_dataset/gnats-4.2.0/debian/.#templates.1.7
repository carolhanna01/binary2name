 GNATS can be set to receive bug reports and database queries through mail.
 However, it seems you are using a mailer I am not able to setup myself, so
 you must do it by hand. The following addresses on localhost and
 appropriate actions for them should be set up:
 .
 gnats: redirect this to GNATS administrator"s address gnats-admin: alias
 for "gnats" bugs: pipe it to the command "| /usr/lib/gnats/queue-pr -q"
 query-pr: pipe it to the command "| /usr/lib/gnats/mail-query"
 ${SITE}-gnats: alias for "bugs"
