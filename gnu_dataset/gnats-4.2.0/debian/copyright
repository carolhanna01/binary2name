This is the Debian package of the GNATS bug monitoring system.

GNATS was originally packaged for Debian by Brian White <bcwhite@pobox.com>.
It had been maintained by Milan Zamazal <pdm@debian.org>, but it is now
maintained by Chad Walstrom <chewie@debian.org>.

The GNATS project home page is hosted at
http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnats.  The software can normally be obtained
via ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnats/ or through the CVS repository at
http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gnats.

Because of the 2003 crack of ftp.gnu.org, the current version was fetched from:
http://www.yngve.com/gnats/gnats-4.0.tar.gz

It's unclear who are the copyright holders of GNATS.
