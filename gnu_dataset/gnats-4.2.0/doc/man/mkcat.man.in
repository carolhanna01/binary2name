.SH DESCRIPTION
Scans the database for any new categories, creating new subdirectories
in the database directory if any are found.
.P
This program is mostly obsolete since directories for categories are
automatically created as necessary, but is left for histerical
reasons.
.P
mkcat should be run by the GNATS user (by default \fBgnats\fR).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d\fR,\fB --database
Specifies the database to be scanned for new categories; if no
database is specified, the database named \fIdefault\fR is assumed.
This option overrides the database specified in the \fBGNATSDB\fR
environment variable.
.TP
.B -h\fR,\fB --help
Displays a short usage message.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
The \fBGNATSDB\fR environment variable is used to determine which database to
use.  For a local database, it contains the name of the database to access.
If \fBGNATSDB\fR is not set, the database named \fIdefault\fR is used.
