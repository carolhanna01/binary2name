.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfile-pr\fR files incoming Problem Reports in the GNATS
database, sends acknowledgments to approriate parties and logs
database activity.
.P
\fBfile-pr\fR assigns the Problem Report an identification number and
then files it in the GNATS database either under the category
specified in the Category field of the PR, or under the default
category if the Category field is nonexistent or contains an invalid
category name.
.P
For the default GNATS configuration, the person responsible for that
category and the person responsible for the submitter site where the
PR originated receive a copy of the PR in its entirety.  Optionally,
the originator of the PR receives an acknowledgment that the PR
arrived and was filed
