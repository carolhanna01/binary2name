.TH gnats 7 "August 2003" "GNATS 4.2.0" "Problem Report Management System"
.SH NAME
gnats \- Problem Report Management System
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B GNATS
is a bug-tracking tool designed for use at a central support site.
Software users who experience problems use tools provided with GNATS
to submit Problem Reports to the the maintainers of that software;
.B GNATS
partially automates the tracking of these problems by:
.TP
.B \(bu
organizing problem reports into a database and notifying responsible
parties of suspected bugs;
.TP
.B \(bu
allowing support personnel and their managers to edit, query and report
on accumulated bugs; and
.TP
.B \(bu
providing a reliable archive of problems with a given program and a
history of the life of the program by preserving its reported problems
and their subsequent solutions.
.LP
.B GNATS
offers many of the same features offered by more generic databases.
You can query and edit existing problem reports (\fIPR\fPs) as well as
obtain reports on groups of PRs.  The database itself is simply an
ordered repository for problem reports; each PR receives a unique,
incremental PR number which identifies it throughout its lifetime.
.LP
Many of the primary functions available with 
.B GNATS
are accessible from within GNU 
.BR Emacs .
.SH "PROBLEM REPORT STATES"
PRs go through several states in their lifetimes.  The set of states is
site-specific.
.LP
The default set of states are:
.TP 2i
.I open
the initial state of every PR;
this means the PR has been filed and the person or group responsible
for it has been notified of the suspected problem
.TP
.I analyzed
the problem has been examined and work toward a solution has begun
.TP
.I feedback
a solution has been found and tested at the support site, and sent to
the party who reported the problem; that party is testing the solution
.TP
.I closed
the solution has been confirmed by the party which reported it
.LP
In some cases, it may be necessary to suspend work on a bug; in this
case, its state changes to
.I suspended
rather than 
.IR closed .
.SH STRUCTURE
Incoming PRs are assigned an incremental serial number and filed
according to category.  An index is kept concurrently to accelerate
searches of the database.
.LP
All 
.B GNATS
administration and database files are located in subdirectories of a
directory associated with each database.  Databases are named, and 
the association between database names and directories is described
by the \fBdatabases\fR file, which is found on this system in 
.B /usr/local/etc/gnats/databases.
.LP
.I Problem Reports
are segregated into subdirectories within the database directory by
category.  For example, problems submitted with a category of
.I gcc
will be filed in the database subdirectory
.BR gcc .
.LP
.B GNATS
administration files are kept in the database subdirectory
.BR gnats-adm :
.TP 1.5i

.B addresses
contains mappings between submitter IDs and corresponding e-mail
addresses
.TP
.B categories
table of valid categories and parties responsible for them
.TP
.B classes
table of valid classes of Problem Reports
.TP
.B current
keeps track of incremental PR numbers assigned
.TP
.B dbconfig
describes the structure of the database, and various database-specific
options
.TP
.B gnatsd.user_access
lists host names and access levels of hosts authorized to access the
database
.TP
.B gnatsd.user_access
lists user names, passwords and access levels of users authorized to
access the database
.TP
.B index
database index
.TP
.B locks
directory containing lock files
.TP
.B responsible
table of responsible parties and their email addresses
.TP
.B states
table of valid states of Problem Reports
.TP
.B submitters
database of sites which submit PRs
.LP
Administrative programs and programs internal to
.B GNATS
are kept in the directory
.BR /usr/local/libexec/gnats
while those meant for public use are installed in
.BR /usr/local/bin.
.LP
.B /usr/local/libexec/gnats
contains the programs:
.TP 1.5i
.B mkdb
used by the
.B GNATS
administrator to create a new database
.TP
.B mkcat
used by the
.B GNATS
administrator to create new categories [obsolete]
.TP
.B rmcat
used by the
.B GNATS
administrator to remove outdated categories [obsolete]
.TP
.B gen\-index
used by the
.B GNATS
administrator to generate a new version of the index
.TP
.B queue-pr
mail control program which accepts incoming messages and periodically
submits them to the database via 
.B cron
by feeding them through the program
.BR file-pr (8)
.TP
.B pr-edit
program which is mainly responsible for editing existing PRs and filing
new ones; it is used by
.BR edit\-pr \ and\  file\-pr
.TP
.B file-pr
script which uses \fBpr\-edit\fR to file new PRs
.TP
.B at-pr
automatically notifies responsible parties if a PR is not analyzed
within a requisite period defined in the
.B submitters
file
.TP
.B delete-pr
used to delete closed PRs
.LP
.B /usr/local/bin
contains the programs
.TP 1.5i
.B query-pr
used to query the database
.TP
.B edit-pr
used to edit individual PRs
.TP
.B send-pr
used to submit problems to 
.B GNATS
.LP
Documentation exists for all programs associated with
.B GNATS.

.SH HISTORY
.B GNATS 
was greatly inspired by the BSD 
.BR sendbug (1)
and
.BR bugfiler (8)
programs.  It was originally written in C++, Elisp, shell script, and
awk.  It presently consists of utilities written in C, shell script,
and Elisp.
.SH AUTHORS
.B GNATS
was originally written by Heinz G. Seidl (Cygnus Support).  Subsequent
iterations were developed by Brendan Kehoe (Cygnus Support) and Jason
Merrill (Cygnus Support), with help from Tim Wicinski.  Documentation
was initially developed by Jeffrey Osier (Cygnus Support) and Brendan
Kehoe (Cygnus Support).
.P
Version 4.x was a substantial rewrite done by Bob Manson (Juniper
Networks), Milan Zamazal and Yngve Svendsen (Clustra Systems / Sun
Microsystems)
