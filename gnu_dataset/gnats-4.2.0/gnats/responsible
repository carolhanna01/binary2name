#		  People responsible for a given PR.
#
# Any line which begins with a `#' is considered a comment, and GNATS
# will ignore it. 
#
# Each entry has the format:
#
#	person:full name:address
#
# * The `person' can either be an abbreviated name, or the person's
#   username (local to the GNATS site) which should be listed in the PR.
# * The `full name' is simply their name, as in "Diane Williams".
# * The `address' field is either empty for local addresses, or should
#   the electronic mail address of the person.
#
# Note that all contact names that appear in other admin files (submitter 
# and category) are also mapped through this file when email is sent.
#
# You MUST have this entry for GNATS to work.  It must be named
# gnats-admin.  If you want the GNATS administrator to have a
# different e-mail address than `gnats-admin', add the desired address
# in the `address' (third) field of this entry.
#
gnats-admin: GNATS administrator:
#
# Sample remote people:
#
# Bill is a local user, so `mail bill' will work.  Al is remote, so he
# should receive the message as `al@senate.gov'.  Finally, joe is
# another local user.
