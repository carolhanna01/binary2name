#		    Possible categories for a PR.
#
# Any line which begins with a `#' is considered a comment, and GNATS
# will ignore it. 
#
# Each entry has the format:
#
# 	category:description:responsible:notify
#
# * `category' is the name of the classification for the PR.  The
#   first category listed will be the default assigned to PRs that
#   arrive without one set.  This is traditionally called "pending".
#
# * `description' can be a normal text description for the
#    category, like "Development Tools" for the `tools' category.
#
# * `responsible' gives the name (which can be found in the responsible
#    file) of the person who will be given responsibility for any PR
#    appearing in this category.
#
# * `notify' are other email addresses which should be given copies of
#    any PR in this category.  These names are also mapped through the
#    responsible file when trying to determine the email address to use.
