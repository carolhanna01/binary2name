In no particular order:

o  Code get-around for the 255 character line limit in gnatsd?
o  Save size and position of all windows. $TkGnats(UserDir)/wgeometry
o  Fix tkpr_library.tcl proc delete_pr_local. It hasn't kept up with the changes.
o  Allow editing of raw data (Jens Krinke <krinke@ips.cs.tu-bs.de>).
o  Show responsible for each category? (Daniel Quinlan <quinlan@transmeta.com>).
o  Add delayed mail sending to allow off-line creation of new bug reports?
o  Add instructions/support for tksendpr stand-alone without gnatsd access.
o  Add a dialog to edit/set configuration parameters? (Paul Traina <pst@juniper.net>).
o  Find a volunteer to test TkGnats on the Macintosh.
   - Mac doesn't use slashes in file names; have to convert path manipulation to
     use Tcl file commands (such as [file join]).
o  Add SUBMITTER as a new field in the servers file?
o  Color configuration
   - short-term: make variable (DONE in TkGnats-3.0.4)
   - long-term:  interactive control similar to the font selector.
o  Option to add the Description field to the edit change notice email.
   (for just certain field changes? Add to client hints system?)

I'm surprised that nobody asked for this sooner. TkGnats can get the email
address (GNAST_ADDR) from gnats, and make the button text something like
"Host:gnats DB: normal" (for your example), but what should it do for the
5th field? Your example above doesn't look right: the 5th field is simply
a subdirectory for a user's config files (saved queries, etc) for a
particular server. I could assume host.alias, which would be gnats.normal
in your case. This might end up as ~/.tkgnatsrc/gnats.normal., for
example.

Somebody asked for this recently. It's on my list.
