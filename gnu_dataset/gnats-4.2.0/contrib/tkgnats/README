    Read all the README files.  ;-)   (They're not that long.)


What is TkGnats?
================

    TkGnats is Tcl/Tk-based front end for the GNATS bug management
    system. While GNATS itself only runs on UNIX platforms, TkGnats
    runs on UNIX and Windows 95/98/NT (as of version 3.0.0). It could
    probably be fixed to run on the Mac, but I'm not able to work on
    this myself.

    On UNIX systems, TkGnats can access the GNATS database from local
    or nfs-mounted disk. UNIX and Windows 95/98/NT systems can access
    the GNATS database through the GNATS network daemon "gnatsd".

    I highly recommend UNIX users use the GNATS daemon instead of
    accessing the GNATS files directly from disk. Performance is often
    better through gnatsd, especially if the GNATS database is NFS
    mounted.

    Screenshots, the latest version of TkGnats and other GNATS
    resources are available at the TkGnats Home Page:

What is GNATS?
==============

    You can get the latest GNATS from 

    ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/gnats/snapshots

    or an ftp site near you that mirrors the GNU software.  It will be
    called something like gnats-3.110-beta.tar.gz. Do not use the very
    old and obsolete gnats-3.2 that is on many web archives.

    Here is a fragment from the GNATS info file that describes GNATS
    in a nutshell...

    This manual documents a suite of utilities called `GNATS', the GNU
    Problem Report Management System.  `GNATS' is a bug-tracking tool
    designed for use at a central support site.  Software users who
    experience problems use electronic mail to communicate these problems
    to the maintainers of that software; `GNATS' partially automates the
    tracking of these problem reports ("PR"s) by:

    * organizing problem reports into a database and notifying
      responsible parties of suspected bugs;

    * allowing support personnel and their managers to edit and query
      accumulated bugs; and

    * providing a reliable archive of problems with a given program and a
      history of the life of the program by preserving its reported
      problems and their subsequent solutions.


What is Tcl/Tk?
===============

    Tk is an X toolkit that uses a interpreted language called Tcl.  If
    you want to know more about Tk/Tcl check out the Tcl/Tk website 
    http://www.scriptics.com and the FAQ for the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup.

    This version of TkGnats uses Tcl/Tk8.0 or newer. It will not work
    with anything older.

    You can get Tcl and Tk from http://www.scriptics.com/download.


The Author
==========

    This version of TkGnats was created by Rick Macdonald from the original
    version 1.3 by Mike Hoegeman.

    When I asked Mike if I could release my version to the world he said:

        From Mike Hoegeman <mh@aurica.graphon.com>, 26 Oct 1996:

        "You can do whatever you like contribution-wise as far as I'm
        concerned, although I would like you to explicitly indicate that I am
        not responsible/associated with your version of TkGnats in any way."


TkGnats Support
===============

    TkGnats discussions are welcome on the GNATS mailing list. Send a
    subscription request to bug-gnats-request@gnu.org. Once subscribed, 
    send posts to bug-gnats@gnu.org.

    I will be happy to answer all questions. Any bug fixes will be gratefully
    accepted. If you have some enhancements or ideas for enhancements I'm
    receptive to those too.

    When sending problems to me, please paste in the contents of the
    Help/ViewConfigurationVariables menu item that appears in the major
    TkGnats windows. This helps me answer your questions right away.

    My email address might change someday. If "rickm@vsl.com" bounces try 
    "rick_macdonald@veritasdgc.com". Be sure to put TKGNATS in the 
    subject line.
