          =================================================
          Email is sent by GNATS and TkGnats in these cases
          =================================================

1) create new problem report (sent by GNATS only).
2) change State with Edit (sent by TkGnats only).
3) change Responsible with Edit (sent by TkGnats only).
3) change Priority or Severity with Edit (sent by TkGnats only).
4) the "Send Email..." option in Query, View and Edit (GNATS and TkGnats).


               =======================================
               TkGnats knows of these email recipients
               =======================================

- the "actual sender" of the original problem report.
- the name(s) in the "Notify-List" field.
- the current "Responsible".
- the "old and new Responsible" when Responsible changed by Edit.

GNATS itself knows of these and many others, but I won't go into
that here.


             ===========================================
             Email sent by GNATS and TkGnats now goes to
             ===========================================

1) create new problem report (sent by GNATS only).

   - bugs (GNATS itself).
   - gnats sends confirmation to the actual sender.
   - gnats sends a copy of the problem report to:
     - the default responsible person.
     - others that we configure.
   - note that TkGnats can't very well send a copy directly to
     anyone since GNATS has to get it first to add the problem report
     number, and other fields.

2) change State with Edit (note: _any_ State change) (TkGnats only);
   change Priority or Severity with Edit (TkGnats only).

   - the Responsible, the actual sender, and the Notify-List.
     - any of these that are the same as the person doing the Edit
       are removed from the address list.
   - this could be modified to be only certain State changes, like
     when the bug is closed, but let's try it like this for awhile.
   - note that GNATS's edit-pr does not do notification when the
     Priority or Severity is changed.

3) change Responsible with Edit (sent by TkGnats only).

   - the old and new Responsible, the actual sender, and the Notify-List.
     - any of these that are the same as the person doing the Edit
       are removed from the address list.

4) the "Send Email..." option in Query, View and Edit (GNATS and TkGnats).

   - bugs (GNATS itself).
     - GNATS sends one copy to the Responsible person, even if it
       was this person who sent the email.
   - optionally the Responsible, actual sender, and the Notify-List.
     - any of these that are the same as the person sending the
       email are removed (gray'ed out) from the address list.
   - note that the Responsible gets two copies: the copy from GNATS
       is the undesirable copy; I'm looking at inhibiting this copy.
       This copy doesn't have "bugs" in the address list like the copy
       sent by TkGnats, so the mailtool "Reply-to-All" option doesn't
       offer "bugs" as a recipient and some replies don't get into the
       Audit-Trail.
