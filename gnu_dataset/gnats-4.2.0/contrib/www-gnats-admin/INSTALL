               wwwgnats_admin - web administration tool for gnats

                              Installation guide

	1. Install gnats and gnatsd, the gnats network server. Run gnatsd under its own
	   user/group to limit the damage possible if the service is compromised.
	   If you want to manage gnats via the web, you will probably also install gnatsweb
	   on the same server to allow users to create, view, and edit PRs.

	2. Some Linux distributions with precompiled packages provide the suexec wrapper
	   in a separate package from the main apache web server. Otherwise configure or
	   recompile Apache to run with suexec enabled. 

	3. Install Apache on the same server as your gnats database.
	   wwwgnats_admin maintains the list of gnats databases in
	   /usr/local/etc/gnats/databases and follows the paths in that file to the
	   directories containing the actual databases (by default in /var/local/gnats). 
	   Although you could reproduce that arrangement on the web server using NFS mounts,
	   it is much simpler to just run a web server for gnats use and administration
	   on the machine with the gnats database.

	4. Change line 1 of wwwgnats_admin.pl to point to the location of your
	   'perl' executable.  Perl must be version 5.

	5. Install the wwwgnats_admin.pl script to run using the same account as the
	   gnats daemon. You should be able to either 

		a. Create a virtual host which runs suexec under that account and place
		   the script in the cgi-bin directory for that virtual host,

		b. Create a public_html/ subdirectory in the home directory of the
		   gnatsd account, as indicated by the UserDir directive in the apache
		   configuration file. Copy the script into that directory so that it is
		   then available via http://hostname/~account/wwwgnats_admin.cgi 

	   Only approach b) has been tested. More information on Apache suexec configuration is
	   available at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html

	6. In the script directory use the htpasswd command from the Apache distribution to
	   create, in the file .htpasswd, the list of users authorized to manage gnats.

	7. Create a .htaccess file to force user checking against the .htpasswd file. i.e.

		AuthUserFile /home/gnats/public_html/admin/.htpasswd
		AuthName Gnats_Admin
		AuthType Basic
		<Limit GET>
		require valid-user
		</Limit>
		<Limit POST>
		require valid-user
		</Limit>
