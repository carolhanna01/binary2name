What is wwwgnats-admin?
======================

	wwwgnats-admin is a bare-bones web interface for configuring Gnats,
	the GNU Problem Report Management System. It allows you to provide
	project managers with the ability to create and customize gnats
	databases without command shell accounts on your gnats server.
	It is a CGI script which runs with the effective userid set to the
	gnats daemon account. The current version has been tested with the
	Apache web server's suexec mode.

System Requirements
===================

	wwwgnats-admin requires that you have the following:
	
	* gnats 4.0 installed and configured

	* a web server supporting a suid mechanism such as Apache-suexec

	* access to the account used for the gnats daemon to install the
	  suexec CGI script.
	
	* Perl 5, with the fine CGI.pm module.


How do I install it?
====================

	Read the INSTALL file.


Who wrote it?
=============

	Mike Sutton created the original CGI script for gnats 3.x. He
	has authorized releasing his code under the GPL.

	Paul-Andre Panon updated the script to support multiple databases
	in gnats 4.0 and to use CGI.pm. The update work was supported by
	Sierra System Group for internal use. Sierra also have authorized
	releasing their updates for gnats 4.0 under the GPL.
