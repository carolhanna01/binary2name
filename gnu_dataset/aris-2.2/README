 Please include enough information for the maintainers to reproduce the
 problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug
  and command line invocations of the program(s) involved (very important!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- the version number of the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- unusual options you gave to configure, if any (see config.status).
- anything else that you think would be helpful.
