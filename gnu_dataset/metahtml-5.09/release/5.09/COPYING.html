  <h3> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION </h3>
</div>
<p>
<ol type="0">
 <li>This License applies to any program or other work created by
     Universal Access Inc. ("UAI"), which contains a notice placed by UAI saying
     it may be distributed under the terms of the UAI Free Software License.
<p>
     As used herein, the term "Program", below, means any
     program or work provided by UAI under the UAI Free Software
     License, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
     Program or any "derivative work" as defined by U.S. copyright law: i.e.,
     a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
     verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
     language.  Hereinafter, translation is included without
     limitation in the term "modification". Each licensee of the
     Program, or any work based on the Program, is referred to as "you".
<p> 
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
     running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
     is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
     Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
<p><br>
 <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
     and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
     along with the Program.
<p>
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<p><br>
 <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
     such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
     provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
	stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<p>
    <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
	whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
	part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
	parties under the terms of this License.
<p>
    <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
	when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
	interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
	announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
	notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
	a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
	these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
	License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
	does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
	the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</ol>
<p>
     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
     on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<p><br>

 <li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<p>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
	source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
	1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
	or,
<p>
    <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
	years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
	of physically performing source distribution, a complete
	machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
	distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	customarily used for software interchange; or,
<p>
    <li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
	to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
	allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
	received the program in object code or executable form with such
	an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</ol>
<p>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the
source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
(compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
<p>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with
the object code.
<p><br>

 <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
     However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
     this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
     parties remain in full compliance.
<p><br>
 <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
     distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
     all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
     the Program or works based on it.
<p><br>
 <li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
     these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
     You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
     this License.
<p><br>
 <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
     distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
     may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
     license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
     all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
     the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
     refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<p><br>

<div align=center>
  <h3>NO WARRANTY</h3>
</div>
<p>
 <li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, UAI PROVIDES THE
  PROGRAM "AS IS", AND MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH
  RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
     TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
     REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<p><br>
<div align=center>
  <h3>LIMITATION OF LIABLILITY</h3>
</div>

 <li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL UAI OR ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
     (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
     INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
     THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
     OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
