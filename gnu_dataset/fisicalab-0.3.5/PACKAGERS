INFORMATION FOR PACKAGERS
===========================

Usually the packagers placed the documentation in a separate package. The
documentation of FisicaLab consist in all the RTFD files at directories
"English.lproj" and "Spanish.lproj", for English and Spanish respectively. In
this case if FisicaLab don't found the documentation, will display a message
with the suggestion to install the documentation package.
