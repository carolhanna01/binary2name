Welcome to GNU FísicaLab 0.3.5!


WHAT IS IT
==========

GNU FisicaLab (can be pronounced as PhysicsLab) is an educational application
to solve physics problems. Its main objective is let the user to focus in
physics concepts, leaving aside the mathematical details (FisicaLab take
care of them). This allows the user to become familiar with the physical
concepts without running the risk of getting lost in mathematical details.
And so, when the user gain confidence in applying physical concepts,
will be better prepared to solve the problems by hand (with pen and paper).
This version of FisicaLab have the following modules:

  * Kinematics of particles 2D.
  * Circular kinematics of particles 2D.
  * Static of particles 2D.
  * Static of rigid bodies 2D.
  * Dynamics of particles 2D.
  * Circular dynamics of particles 2D.
  * Heat, calorimetry, ideal gas and expansion.

The static and dynamic problems are entered constructing the free body
diagrams of the objects. Although FísicaLab is easy and intuitive, we recommend
you read the help files first before set any problem. You can access these
 files in the option menu "Info -> Help" (or "FisicaLab -> Info -> Help").

FisicaLab is part of project GNU (www.gnu.org).
