Changes in version 0.3.5:

	* Correction of a bug in the module dynamics of points, due to a bad
	set of equations. This causes that some problems can be solved with
	some parameters, but not with others.
	* Fixed two problems with the contextual menu of conversions.
	* Added a module to handle tables of properties (needed for future
	modules of thermodynamics and fluids). Also added a window that allow
	calculate the properties of water. 
	* Minor changes for compatibility with Windows platform.

Changes in version 0.3.4:

	* Connect the radio buttons at UI, to select the units system, 
	with the model. In version 0.3.3, the user can change the system, 
	but the model don't does the corresponding change. I noticed this 
	some days ago.
