This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of Ian Jackson's
`SAUCE' anti-spam software utility.

This package was put together from the upstream sources by the
upstream author.  Please contact Ian Jackson at
<ian@davenant.greenend.org.uk> for matters relating to the Debian
package in particular or <sauce-maint@chiark.greenend.org.uk> for
general enquiries about sauce.

The changes were to add support for the Debian package maintenance
scheme, by adding various debian/*.  There is currently no automatic
integration of this package with your existing mail transfer system;
the sauce software is installed and configured pretty much ready to
run, but you must arrange yourself for it to be invoked.
