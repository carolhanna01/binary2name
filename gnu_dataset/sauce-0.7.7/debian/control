Description: SMTP defence software against spam
 SAUCE (Software Against Unsolicited Commerical Email) sits between
 the Internet and your existing Mail Transfer Agent (e.g. Exim).  It
 does a number of checks on incoming mail, including being able to
 blacklist senders and their sites automatically when they mail
 special `spam bait' addresses.
