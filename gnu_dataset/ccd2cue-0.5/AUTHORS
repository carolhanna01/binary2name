   This file contains a list of people that made sufficiently large
contributions to development that they can be regarded as truly authors
of the program.  This program would not be what it is today without the
invaluable help of these people, to whom we would like to say:

                        *THANK YOU VERY MUCH!*

   The names are listed in chronological order of contribution.  Each
person’s contact information, usually email, and a summary of that
person’s contribution is put in per correspondent section.

   For contributions that does not matter for copyright purposes, e.g.,
minor or non-source code contributions, see file ‘THANKS’.  If you would
appreciate your own name listed here, *please contribute!*  See the
“Contributing” section of the ‘README’ file.
