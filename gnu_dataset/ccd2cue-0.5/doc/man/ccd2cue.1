.SH NAME
ccd2cue \- CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ccd2cue
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR...] [\fI\,ccd-file\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert CCD sheet to CUE sheet.
.PP
The input file, referred as 'ccd\-file', must exist.  If 'ccd\-file' is '\-', or
omitted, standard input is used.  It is necessary to supply at least one file
name, in an option or non\-option argument, in order to deduce the remaining
file names needed, and only one file name of each type can be supplied.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cd\-text\fR=\fI\,cdt\-file\/\fR
write CD\-Text data to 'cdt\-file'
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\,cue\-file\/\fR
write output to 'cue\-file'
.IP
While the main output file 'cue\-file' is always generated, the 'cdt\-file' is
created only when there is CD\-Text data.  If 'cue\-file' is '\-', or '\-\-output'
is omitted, standard output is used.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-absolute\-file\-name\fR
use absolute file name deduction
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-image\fR=\fI\,img\-file\/\fR
reference 'img\-file' as the image file
.IP
The 'img\-file' is a reference to a data file required only in burning time and
thus its existence is not enforced at conversion stage.
.TP
\-?, \fB\-\-help\fR
Give this help list
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Give a short usage message
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
.SH EXAMPLES
The most ordinary use case is when you have a CCD set of files and just want to
generate a CUE sheet file in order to burn or otherwise access the data inside
the image file.  Supposing your CCD sheet file is called gnu.ccd, you are done
with the command:
.IP
ccd2cue \-o gnu.cue gnu.ccd
.PP
If you have burned a CD from a CUE sheet produced by this program and all audio
tracks became only senseless static noise, you may need to tell your burning
software to swap the byte order of all samples sent to the CD\-recorder.  This
can be accomplished with (for example) the '\-\-swap' option when using the
\&'cdrdao' program.  Experience has shown that at least for mixed\-mode discs it
is necessary to use that option when burning, otherwise you will almost
certainly waste a CD.
.PP
Supposing you want to burn a CD using the 'cdrdao' program and a CUE sheet file
named 'gnu.cue', and wisely want to ensure the correct behavior of your burnt
disc, use the command:
.IP
cdrdao write \-\-swap \-\-speed 1 \-\-eject gnu.cue
.PP
That way 'cdrdao' will swap the byte order of audio samples, cautiously burning
in the smallest possible speed and will eject your CD when it is done.
