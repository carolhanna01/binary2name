GNU ccd2cue 0.5 (March 13, 2015)
********************************

   GNU ccd2cue is a CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter.  It supports the
full extent of CUE sheet format expressiveness, including mixed-mode
discs and CD-Text meta-data.  It plays an important role for those who
need to use optical disc data which is only available in the proprietary
sheet format CCD, but don’t want to surrender their freedom.  It fills
an important gap in the free software world because before its
conception it was impossible to use complex forms of optical disc data
laid out by CCD sheets in a whole/holy free operating system.

   The GNU ccd2cue documentation is also intended to be a reference
documentation for both sheet format specifications.  That way we can
reverse engineer the secret CCD sheet proprietary format only once and
then make the information available for developers in order to benefit
all free software users that want their software to be interoperable.
The CUE sheet format is not a secret, but with this package we take the
opportunity to ensure that its specification is available under a free
documentation license for the sake of the whole free software community.

Download
========

Here are the compressed sources and a GPG detached signature:
     https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-0.5.tar.gz
     https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-0.5.tar.gz.sig

Use a mirror for higher download bandwidth:
     http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-0.5.tar.gz
     http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/ccd2cue/ccd2cue-0.5.tar.gz.sig

   Use a ‘.sig’ file to verify that the corresponding file (without the
‘.sig’ suffix) is intact.  First, be sure to download both the ‘.sig’
file and the corresponding tarball.  Then, run a command like this:

     gpg --verify ccd2cue-0.5.tar.gz.sig

   If that command fails because you don’t have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

     gpg --recv-keys 0x28D618AF --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net

and rerun the ‘gpg --verify’ command.

   This release is signed by _Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro_.  His key
fingerprint is ‘7CB1 208C 7336 56B7 5962 2500 27B9 C6FD 28D6 18AF’.

This release was bootstrapped with the following tools:
   • GNU Autoconf 2.69
   • GNU Automake 1.14.1
   • GNU Texinfo 5.2
