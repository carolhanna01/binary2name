To install the www-cgi service:

1. Run make to build ucgi and ucgitarget.

2. Create the directory /usr/local/lib/user-cgi/cgi

3. Install the programs:
(a) ucgitarget as /usr/local/lib/user-cgi/target
(b) ucgi as /usr/local/lib/user-cgi/ucgi
(c) a symlink /usr/local/lib/user-cgi/ucgi-debug -> ucgi
(d) the script `check' as /usr/local/lib/user-cgi/check

4. Put the extra ScriptAlias directives in srm.conf.fragment in the
appropriate part of your webserver configuration.

5. Install the userv service:
(a) Put the file www-cgi in /etc/userv/services.d (you may need to
    adjust it for your local configuration)
(b) If you don't already have it, add this line to /etc/userv/system.default:
    include-lookup service /etc/userv/services.d

6. As a test user, create a `public-cgi' directory, and a symlink in
it called `check' which points to /usr/local/lib/user-cgi/check.

7. Test that all is working by visiting
