groupmanage - installation instructions

'groupmanage' is /usr/local/bin/groupmanage - NOT setuid root
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root /usr/local/bin/groupmanage
'groupmanage.conf' is /etc/groupmanage.conf - edit to taste
-rw-rw-r--   1 root     root /etc/groupmanage.conf
'services' is (typically) /etc/userv/services.d/groupmanage
-rw-rw-r--   1 root     root /etc/userv/services.d/groupmanage

Edit /etc/userv/system.default to add a line
	include-lookup service /etc/userv/services.d
if you don't have one already.

groupmanage depends on /etc/environment setting up a sensible PATH.
/etc/grouplist must exist.  We suggest inserting the comment
# Syntax:
# group:description:manager:maint-users:home
There must be no blank lines in /etc/grouplist.
