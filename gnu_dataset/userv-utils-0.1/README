This is userv-utils.  It is a collection of utilities, scripts and example
configuration files that serve both as examples for how to use userv, and in
some cases, hopefully as useful programs and services.

Please see each individual directory for any details, installation
instructions, documentation, invididual copyright statements, and anything
else, that is available.

If you do not know what userv is, see its WWW page at
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/userv/.  For now at least, the
userv mailing lists should be used to discuss these and other
userv-using programs.

Please send bug reports and suggestions to
userv-maint@chiark.greenend.org.uk, or to the userv-discuss mailing
list if you are subscribed to it.


Here is a quick summary of the currently available utilities

Directory	Status	Description (UC=`users can ...')
--------------- -----	------------------------------------------------
groupmanage	Y Y A	UC create groups, add/remove members, &c
www-cgi		Y B A	UC provide CGIs which run as themselves
ipif		Y B P   UC create IP interfaces/tunnels (Linux-specific)
misc/mailq	Y S S	UC list mail queue even if sendmail forbids
misc/ndc-reload	Y S S	UC reload named after editing own zone files
newsrc-lg	X B X	Acquire list of subscribed groups from .newsrcs

Key to the Status:
 First letter is completeness:
   Y	Complete.
   P	Partially complete, some glue or modification needed.
   X	Incomplete.  Much extra stuff is required.
 Second letter is general status:
   Y	Released; hopefully of production quality.
   B	Beta.  Not released, but hopefully useful with care.
   A	Alpha.  Probably buggy.  Not well tested or widely used.
   X	Example/experimental - for documentation purposes only,
        not recommended for use.
   S	Too small for this question to be relevant.
 Third letter is documentation:
   Y	Full installation and use instructions included.
   A	Documentation is believed largely adequate, but a bit rough.
   P    Partial documentation or hints.  Good sysadmins should cope.
   X    No documentation.  Good luck !
   S	Too small to need any significant documentation.
