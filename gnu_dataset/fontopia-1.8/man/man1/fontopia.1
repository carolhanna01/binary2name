fontopia \- the console bitmap font editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fontopia [OPTIONS] [file-name]
.SH DESCRIPTION

About:
.br
======
.br
Fontopia is an easy-to-use, text-based, console font editor.
What this means in simple English is that you can edit the fonts
that your GNU/Linux kernel is using to display your text on
text-based (vs graphical) terminals.

Unlike other console text editors which usually work on one PSF
version, or work on unicode tables only, or allow very minimal glyph
editing, fontopia provides all these functions together:
.br
- It works on both PSF 1 & 2, you can even change file type and save
  it to disk in the other version.
.br
- It allows exporting and importing of unicode tables from external
  files.
.br
- It provides a user-friendly, easy-to-use glyph editor.
.br
- It can easily change font metrics, e.g. length, width, height...
.br
Console font files are commonly of PSF type (of which there are two
versions), or of CP type (legacy fonts). Fontopia works with PSF files
of both versions, as well as CP, PCF, BDF files and raw font files.
.br

What's new:
.br
===========
- We added support for the PCF (Portable Compiled Format) fonts. Work 
is ongoing on Windows FON and FNT files.
- We added the Extended Glyph Operations window (accessed by pressing O) 
and the Glyph Info window (accessed by pressing G).

Supported formats:
.br
==================
.br
- PSF 1 and 2
.br
- Linux Code pages (CP)
.br
- Raw fonts
.br
- BDF fonts (beta)
.br
- PCF fonts
.br
- Windows FON & FNT files support under development
.br

WARNING:
.br
========
.br
(1) There is a major downside currently: fontopia doesn't work with unicode
sequences properly (at least not in all cases). If you export a unicode
table, edit it, and then import it to a font file, you should be safe.
.br
(2) Note that if you changed the font version from CP to any other version,
only the ACTIVE font will be changed, as the other font formats (PSF,
Raw, BDF) don't support multiple fonts inside the same font file. In this
case, you will need to open the original CP file multiple times, every
time select a different font size (by using '1'-'4' number keys) and
convert to the new font version, then reopen the original CP file, select
another font size, convert it, and so on.
.br

Navigation:
.br
===========
.br
Using the editor is very easy:
.br
(1)  Navigate the glyphs on the right side window using the arrow keys.
 Edit a single glyph using ENTER (or TAB).
.br
(2)  Navigate the bits that form a single bit (on the left side window)
 using arrow keys. Press ENTER or SPACE to set/unset the desired bit.
 Go back to right window (glyph list) using TAB.
.br
(3)  To zoom in (make the glyph on the left look bigger), press Z.

.br
(31) If editing a CP font and you want to change the active font (e.g.
     edit the 8x8 font instead of the 16x8 font you are currently editing)
     press any key from '1' to '4' and the respective font will be the
     active font to be edited. You can go back and forth by using the
     number keys.
.br

The unicode values that are mapped to a specific glyph are shown on the
status bar (the bottom strip) to the right side.
