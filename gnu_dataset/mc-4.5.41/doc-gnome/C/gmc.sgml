    GNOME includes a file manager that allows you to manipulate the files on
    your system in a comfortable, powerful, graphical environment. This File
    Manager is known as GMC for GNU Midnight Commander.  GMC is based on the
    Midnight Commander file manager which can be run in a terminal.
   </para>
   <para>
    Midnight Commander has long been known for its power and ease of use. GMC
    has taken the power and ease of use from MC and added the GNOME graphical
    frontend.
   </para>
   <para> As mentioned in the previous chapter, the GNOME File Manager provides
    the desktop functionality for GNOME.  The GNOME File Manager also provides a
    place to manipulate files on your system by using the GNOME File Manager
    window.

   </para>
   <para>
    There are two main windows within the GNOME File Manager. On the left is the
    tree view, which represents all of the directories on your system by their
    hierarchical position. On the right is the directory window, which will show
    you the contents of the directory which you have selected in the tree view.
   </para>
   <para>
    To select a directory in the tree view simply use a single mouse click. This
    will change the main directory view, showing the files in the directory you
    have  chosen. If there is a plus sign to the left of a directory name in the
    tree window, you may click on it to show subdirectories.  At this point the
    plus sign will have changed to a minus sign. If you click on the minus
    sign, the subdirectory once again becomes hidden in the tree view and the
    plus sign reappears.

      Viewing Files
     </secondary>
    </indexterm>     
      The directry window has a few viewing options you may wish to
      take advantage of: the icon view and three list views: brief,
      detailed and custom.  
   </para>
   <para>
    The Icon view is the default view and will display large icons for each
    file.  The Brief view shows the files and directories in a list. The
    Detailed view expands this list to include information about the files. The
    Custom view is a list view that allows you to select the information you
    want to view about files.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the  Brief, Detailed, and Custom  views if you click on one of the
    information titles on the top of the window it will sort the files according
    to that information. For example, if you want to find the largest files in
    the directory you can click on the Size title and the files will be sorted
    by size from largest to smallest. One more click on the Size title will
    change the sorting from smallest to largest.

    The GNOME File Manager is also equipped to view FTP sites. To 
    view an FTP site  you will need to be connected to the Internet either
    through a dial up account or a network. Type the FTP address in the Location
    text box and the GNOME File Manager will attempt to connect to the site.
   </para>
   <para>
    Make sure you type in FTP addresses in the following manner:
    <programlisting>ftp://[site address]</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    Above the Location text box are navigation buttons you might wish to
    use. The buttons with the arrow icons allow you to move within the
    directories adjacent to the one you are in. The left button will take you to
    the previous directory you were in, the middle button will take 	you up one
    level in the directory hierarchy, and the right button will take you to the
    next directory if you have just moved backwards.

     Selecting files is done with your mouse by clicking on the file or files in
     the GNOME File Manager.  The file that is selected will then highlight to
     show you that it has been selected.

      Selecting multiple files 
     </secondary>
    </indexterm>
     There are a couple of ways to select more than one file. One way is to use
     the "rubber band" select by clicking and dragging the mouse cursor around
     several files. This action will produce a small dotted line, the "rubber
     band", to show you the area in which files will be selected.

     </figure>
    <para>
      If you wish to be more selective about the files you are choosing, or the
      files you need do not reside next to one another, you may use the
      <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key to keep the files you have selected while you
      are selecting more. This works by selecting a file, pressing and holding
      the <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key and selecting another file. While the
      <keycap>CTRL</keycap> key is pressed you will be able to add to the "list"
      of files that are selected. Once you have selected multiple files by
      either method you may copy or move the files.
    </para>
    <para>
     You may also select all files in a directory by selecting the
    <guimenuitem>Select All</guimenuitem> menu item from the
    <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu.

    You may also filter your selection by using the <guimenuitem>Select 
    Files</guimenuitem> menu item in the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu. Using
    <guimenuitem>Select Files</guimenuitem> will display a simple dialog which
    will allow you to type in criteria for your selection. In this field, the
    symbol <keycap>*</keycap> is interpreted as a wildcard, E.g., it matches any
    string.  For example, if you would like to select all files in the directory
    that start with the letter <keycap>D</keycap>, you can type
    <keycap>D*</keycap> (note that filenames in Unix are case-sensitive).

    The default action for dragging and dropping files between the GNOME File
    Manager and the desktop is to move them. But you can also use drag and drop
    to copy a file by pressing the <keycap>SHIFT</keycap> key while dragging the
    file(s). You can also drag a file within the file manager to another
    directory. Select the file in the main window and drag it to the desired
    directory in the tree window. Note, however, that when dragging to the tree
    window the default action is to copy the file. As you drag the file to the
    tree window, you will see a plus sign appear to remind you that theh file
    will be copied. You can also use drag and drop to copy directories the same
    way as you did for files.  Again note the plus sign signifying that the
    directory will be copied, not moved.

    You may also bring up a menu which lets you decide what action to perform
    with a drag by using the middle mouse button to drag a file or pressing the
    <keycap>ALT</keycap> key while dragging a file. Once you release the drag
    you will get a pop-up menu which contains the options Copy, Move, Link, and
    Cancel Drag.
   </para>
 <!-- E makes this useless!!! That is broken!
   <para>
    Another way to copy or move files is to take advantage of the right mouse
    click <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu. Right mouse click on the file you
    want to copy or move and select <guimenuitem>Move/rename</guimenuitem> or
    <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu.
    This will bring up a dialog in which to perform thes tasks.  </para> -->

    To use the move dialog you simply type in the path where you wish to move
    the file. If you want to rename the file you may type the new name of the
    file in the path string. The Copy dialog looks and works exactly the same
    way as the Move/rename dialog.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the file you are moving is a symbolic link &mdash; that is, a virtual
    link to where the file actually resides (called a shortcut in some other
    operating systems) &mdash; you may select the <guilabel>Advanced
    Options</guilabel> tab and select <guilabel>Preserve symlinks</guilabel>.
    Selecting this will make sure the link is preserved despite the move.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is recommended that you use this method of moving a symbolic link.

     Renaming files

   </indexterm>
    Renaming files in the GNOME File Manager window or on the desktop
    can be achieved in two ways. 
   </para>
   <para>
    One method of renaming a file is to right mouse click on the file and choose
    the <guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> menu item from the
    <guimenu>pop-up</guimenu> menu. In the Filename text box you may type in
    the new name as you wish it to appear.

       </graphic>
     </screenshot>
     </figure>
   <para>
    A shortcut method to rename a file is to slowly double click on the filename
    in the icon view or on the desktop.  Make sure the double-click is slow so
    you do not launch the file but you simply highlight and then click again.
    At this point the name of the file will enter into the editing mode, your
    mouse cursor will change to an editing line, and you can type in the new
    name. Once the name is as you would like it to be you may press the
    <keycap>Enter</keycap> key to end the editing process.

    The GNOME File Manager allows you to launch applications from the main

    application associated with it. You can change the way file types are
    handled by reading the Mime Capplet Chapter in the GNOME User's Guide.

    <guimenuitem>pop-up</guimenuitem> menu. This will bring up a dialog that
    allows you to define the application which will launch the file. For example,
    if you want to edit a file named test.txt with
    <application>Emacs</application> (a  popular text editor), you can right mouse
    click on test.txt and choose <guimenuitem>Open with</guimenuitem>. When you
    get the Open with dialog box simply type in emacs in front of the test.txt
    file name. When you press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
    <application>Emacs</application> will open the file.

     There are many tips and tricks  to the Desktop in GNOME. The Drag and Drop 
     functionality extends to many areas of GNOME making it easy to interconnect
     GNOME in many interesting ways. Below is a series of tips and tricks to 
     using GNOME Drag and Drop. This is a good tour of GNOME and will show you 
     how to utilize GNOME to its fullest extent.

      Drag to an Application - Many GNOME compliant applications will accept 
      drag and drop. If you would like to open a file in Gnumeric, a GNOME 
      compliant spreadsheet application, you may simply drag the  file from the
      GNOME File Manager onto Gnumeric and it will open the file.  The same is
      true for applications built using Motif. You may drag a saved URL onto 
      Netscape 4x and it will open the URL. This can be very useful if you are
      working within the GNOME File Manager and wish to quickly open a file.

      Adding an Application Launcher to the Panel - If you would like to add an
      application launcher to the Panel you may drag and drop any executable 
      file from the GNOME File Manager, or the Desktop, onto the Panel. This 
      will display the Create Launcher applet dialog box which will allow you to
      select a name and an icon for that launcher.

      Dragging Files - There are many ways to use drag and drop to help you
      manage your system. You can open two GNOME File Manager windows selecting
      two different directories then drag files between the two windows to copy, 
      move, or link files. You can drag files from the File Manager to the 
      desktop to make it more accessible. Use the middle mouse button or the 
      right and left mouse buttons together and Drag a directory folder to the
      desktop. Choose the link option from the pop-up menu to make a link to the
      desktop. This will give you a quick way to launch the File Manager to that 
      directory.

      Dragging Directories - You can drag a directory out of the GNOME File 
      Manger and place it on the Panel. This will create a new menu which allows 
      you easy access to the files in that directory.
     </para>

     <para>
      You may drag any sub menu from the Main Menu to the panel and a new menu 
      launcher is added to the panel. This allows easier access to that sub-set
      of menus.
