garpd - Gratuitous ARP Daemon:
------------------------------
Broadcasts Gratuitous ARPs for a list of MAC address <-> IP address
mappings on specified interfaces at regular intervals.

A gratuitous ARP request is an AddressResolutionProtocol request
packet where the source and destination IP are both set to the IP of
the machine issuing the packet and the destination MAC is the
broadcast address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff. Ordinarily, no reply packet will
occur. Gratuitous ARP reply is a reply to which no request has been
made.

Gratuitous ARPs are useful to update ARP tables of switches, routers
and other hosts to route packets to a designated IP address.

Garpd was developed as a part of GNU FreeIPMI project. Some of the
IPMI implementations doesn't implement GARP broadcast functionality in
their NICS. When the host OS is down and BMC is active listening for
IPMI packets on the NIC, it needs to inform other switches/routers to
route packets to its NIC. Because Garpd is useful for other purposes
too, we decided to make it as a separate project.
