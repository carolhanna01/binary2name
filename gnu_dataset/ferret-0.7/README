README for Ferret 0.7
---------------------


0. What is Ferret?


Ferret is a tool that aid you in creating data models and then
(perhaps) implementing it on a relational database.

You can draw your data model via an entity-relation diagram, generate
the tables from it (another graphical diagram) and then generate the
SQL or FerretML that mirror such relational tables. Currently several SQL
dialects are supported (for most popular free software database
systems) and the FerretML generation makes to support more targets
very easy (writing a XSL for the translation from the XML to some SQL
dialect, for example). 



1. How do i run Ferret?

To type:

     $ ferret

should work if you have tcl/tk installed in your GNU system.



2. Where can i find updates and Ferret related material?


On the Ferret homepage: http://www.gnuferret.org

You can also go directly to the GNU Ferret savannah page:
http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/ferret


3. Where is the documentation?


Hmm... currently there is not documentation, sorry.

Anyway, the tool is fairly simple and (i hope) intuitive. If you
become confused using ferret, feel free to ask on jemarch@gnu.org


4. How can i enlarge the draw space?


Use the arrow keys to change the canvas size:


             - vertical

                  ^
                  |
                  |
- horizontal  <--- --->   + horizontal
                  |
                  |
                  v
       
             + vertical
