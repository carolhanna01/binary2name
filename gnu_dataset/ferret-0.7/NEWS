New in Ferret 0.7...
--------------------

- License update: GPLv3+ for the code.

New in GerWin 0.6...
--------------------

- New attribute option "del/edit", that lead you to edit a previously
  inserted attribute.

- New painting algorithm for the Table Diagram to support loops on
  key migration. Now the labels with the migrated attributes are
  movable.

- The horrible bug forbiding loops on key migration has been fixed.

- Fixed a bug with internal counters.

- Now GerWin generates good SQL to support foreign keys, grouping all the
  attributes migrated from an referred table in one ADD FOREIGN KEY
  sentence. This applies for the output formats SQL92, POSTGRESQL and
  MYSQL. 

- Yet another file format change, sorry. To upgrade your existing
  (0.5) .ger files, read FILE_MIGRATION-0.5-to-0.6

- Documentation still in progress... :/

New in GerWin 0.5...
--------------------


- Bugfixing release


New in GerWin 0.4...
--------------------


- A more rational interface.

- Support for generate various output formats on the same session.

- Now output consist of the three built-in SQL dialects (sql92, postgresql 
  and mysql) and GerwinML, a xml language to express the table
  diagram. A DTD for GerwinML is included in the gerwinml/ directory,
  so you can write a XSL to translate from GerwinML to everything you
  want.

- Now the several output formats are RE-driven colored! :)

- Another file format change, sorry. To upgrade your existing .ger
  files, just delete the sql-file line from it (that is, the line
  number 3). That should work.


- Documentation still in progress... :/
