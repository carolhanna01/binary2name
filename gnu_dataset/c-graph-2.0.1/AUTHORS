GNU C-Graph 2.0 is a derivative work based on my Honours dissertation
"Interactive Computer Package Demonstrating: Sampling Convolution and
the FFT", submitted April 1983 in partial fulfillment of the degree of
Bachelor of Science (Engineering) Honours, University of Aberdeen
(Scotland).

I am the sole author of GNU C-Graph 2.0 and the above-named Honours
dissertation, which I wrote during my Honours year (October 1982 -
April 1983) at the University of Aberdeen. As a GNU package, further
development of C-Graph should be driven and encompassed by the
collaborative spirit of the Free Software Movement. Contributions from
other developers are welcome.
