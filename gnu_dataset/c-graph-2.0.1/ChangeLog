2019-01-08  Paul Hardy <unifoundry@unifoundry.com>, as directed by
	    Adrienne Gaye Thompson <agt@codeartnow.com>.
	* Version 2.0.1
	* Update packaging with autoconf 2.69 and automake 1.16.1.
	* Ran "autoreconf -f -i -v" to update all GNU Autotools files
	  after changes to Makefile.am files and to configure.ac.
	* COPYING: updated terms.
	* INSTALL, Makefile.in, */Makefile.in: autoreconf updated files.
	* Makefile.am:
	  - Added new "man" directory to SUBDIRS definition.
	  - Commented out "nobase_dist_pkgdata_DATA" definition and
	    replaced with "dist_doc_DATA" definition so documentation
	    files will be installed in $(prefix)/share/doc/c-graph
	    directory instead of $(prefix)/share/c-graph directory.
	    Added "NEWS" file to that list of document files that get
	    installed.
	* build-aux directory:
	  - New "install-sh", "mdate-sh", "missing", and "texinfo.tex" files.
	  - Installed latest GNU release of texinfo.tex (2018-03-10.14)
	    after running "autoreconf -f -i -v"; automake 1.16.1 insesrts
	    an older version during autoreconf.
	  - "depcomp" file is no longer present.
	* configure.ac:
	  - Changed version from "2.0" to "2.0.1".
	  - Added new "man/Makefile" file to AC_CONFIG_FILES definition.
	* doc directory:
	  - "*.png", "*.txt": preceded all original PNG filenames
	    with "c-graph-" for installation in $(prefix)/share/info
	    directory, to avoid name conflicts with other packages
	    placing graphics files there.  Also preceded the original
	    "*.txt" filenames that described those PNG files with
	    "c-graph-", so the ".png" and ".txt" file basenames still
	    match each other.
	  - Makefile.am:
	    - Changed names of the above ".png" and ".txt" files in 
	      the EXTRA_DIST definition.
	    - Added targets to install and uninstall c-graph-*.png
	      files into/from $(infodir) for emacs, because c-graph.texi
	      includes them.  Commented them out for now in doc/Makefile.am.
	  - c-graph.texi:
	    - Updated license from GFDL 1.2+ to GFDL 1.3+.
	    - @direntry: "C-Graph::" changed to "C-Graph: (c-graph)."
	      for lookup via "info c-graph".
	    - The included image files add their new "c-graph-" name prefix.
	    - A few typographic changes in math mode.
	* man directory: created directory
	  - Created man/c-graph.1.
	  - Created man/Makefile.am.
	* src/Makefile.am: added ".NOTPARALLEL:" target to avoid issues
	  exhibited with parallel compilation & linking of FORTRAN modules.
	* src/c-graph.F90:
	  - Updated introductory comments.
	  - Updated welcome message and copyright subroutine.
	  - Line 54: added "-loop 1" parameter to "animate" system call
	    so splash screen would disappear after initial animation
	    loop and 6 second pause.
	  - Line 62: changed "2.0" in version string to "2.0.1".
	* src/fftmod.f90:
	  - Updated introductory comments.
	* src/get-cgopt.f90:
	  - Updated introductory comments.
	  - Line 36->36,38: in subroutine "display_option", commented
	    out definition of version variable as a real and redefined
	    as a character to allow a version of "2.0.1".
	  - Line 50->52: removed extra comma in write statement.
	  - Line 88->90,91: in subroutine "get_version", commented out
	    definition of version parameter "ver" as real and redefined
	    as a character to allow a version of "2.0.1".
	  - Line 90->93,94: commented out old line that wrote version
	    as a real variable and added new line to write version "2.0.1"
	    as a character array variable.
