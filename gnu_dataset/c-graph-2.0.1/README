1. ABOUT GNU C-Graph 

C-Graph is an interactive package for GNU/Linux that demonstrates the
mathematical operation of convolution underlying natural phenomena
susceptible to analysis in terms of engineering signals and systems
theory. "C-Graph" is an abbreviation for "Convolution Graph".

The package is derived from my BSc. Honours dissertation in Electrical
Engineering "Interactive Computer Package Demonstrating: Sampling
Convolution and the FFT", University of Aberdeen (1983). I wrote the
code in Fortran 77; visit <http://codeartnow.com/law-project> for
copies.

For some years, I considered how to contribute to the GNU Project,
which has revolutionised access to, development of, and the philosophy
surrounding computer software. In 2008, having found that my NAILS
package was incompatible with GNU philosophy (as the code consists of
solutions to a non-free book), I reconsidered my 1983 Honours
dissertation which I believed formed the basis for a valuable tool for
students of signal theory - today.

Although I had rewritten the 5 core subroutines of my Disertation in
1996 using C, then released the package in 2008 as C-Graph version
1.0, I felt the learning curve for Fortran would be less steep than
that for C (even though I had last coded in C in 1997, compared with
Fortran in 1983). The question then arose of which version of Fortran
to use. Up to 9 April 2009, the Wikipedia page for Fortress stated
that "Fortress is intended to be a successor to Fortran". I mistakenly
presumed from this and other articles on Fortress that Fortran would
soon be obsolete, so it made little sense to invest the time learning
modern Fortran.

I began the project to re-learn Fortran 77 on 5 February
2009. Fortunately, on 11 February 2009, I posted to the
comp.lang.fortran newsgroup thread "Fortran Lesson: Are these
equivalent?". The members of the group quickly persuaded me to leave
Fortran 77 behind, and by 24 April 2009 I had taken the project to the
point at which I had submitted the original Dissertation, uploading
the code to my website at:
<http://codeartnow.com/code/download/c-graph-1/c-graph-version-2-preview>

2. OBTAINING GNU C-Graph 

The home page for GNU C-Graph is <http://www.gnu.org/software/c-graph/>

Use the following links to download C-Graph:
    http://ftp.gnu.org/gny/c-graph/
    http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html
    http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/c-graph/
    
The second link will take you to a list of mirror sites, while the
third link will redirect you to the nearest mirror.



3. INSTALLATION

GNU C-Graph is designed for the GNU/Linux operating system, and
requires ImageMagick and Gnuplot. Follow these links for downloads:

ImageMagick - http://www.imagemagick.org
Gnuplot - http://www.gnuplot.info/download.html

You will find instructions for building and installing GNU
C-Graph in the file INSTALL. See the file COPYING for terms and
conditions.



4. HELP and BUG REPORTS

Bug reports should contain sufficient information to replicate the
problem. This should include:

    * The operating system (get this with "uname -a");
    * An outline of the problem;
    * Samples of any erroneous output;
    * The error messages generated;
    * Any unusual options given to configure while building (check 
      config.status); 
    * Any other information that might be useful.
