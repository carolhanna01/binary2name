This is a wish-list of features for future versions of GNU C-Graph:

1.	Add pulse trains for each periodic signal with decreasing 
	pulse width to approach Dirac comb.
2.	Animate the convolution.
3.	Visualization of convolutional operators in computer vision. 
	Application of pointspread functions (e.g., gaussian, pillbox, 
	sobel) to edge detection and other filtering operations.
4.	Include even and odd versions of each periodic function.
5.	Consider upgrading the FFT.
