@deffn {Procedure} kotk [name]
Return the contents of stash @var{name} (a symbol), as
an alist with symbolic keys, integer values.
If @var{name} is omitted, the keys are the names of the all
the enum- and flagstashes, and the values have the form:

@example
(N TYPE)
@end example

@noindent
where @var{n} is the count of symbols in that stash,
and @var{type} is a symbol: @code{enums} or @code{flags}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Procedure} enum->number stash symbol
Return the number in @var{stash} associated with @var{symbol}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Procedure} number->enum stash number
Return the symbol associated with @var{number}, or @code{#f}
if it does not belong to @var{stash}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Procedure} flags->number stash flags
Use @var{stash} to convert @var{flags} to a number.
@var{flags} is a list of symbols;
or @code{#f}, which is taken as the empty list;
or @code{#t}, which is taken as the list of all
possible symbols in @var{stash}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Procedure} number->flags stash number
Use @var{stash} to convert @var{number} to a list of symbols.
If the flags in @var{stash} are not sufficient to decode
@var{number}, the first element of the list is the numeric
remainder.
@end deffn
